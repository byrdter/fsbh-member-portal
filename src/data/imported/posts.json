This pandemic is not a hurricane, tornado, or other short-lived tragedy: it’s a global game-changer. Under Theresa Anderson Puryear’s leadership, COO negotiated a contract with Atlanta Airport Marriott for Reunion 2021. As I addressed at Reunion 2019, we would love to bring Reunion 2021 back to Hall County, but it just will not work. Theresa and her team have evaluated every possible option. Each one was either unfeasible, unsafe, or undoable. To keep the cost as low as possible, the BOD decided to raise $8,000 to subsidize the cost. Without the subsidy, the prices would be $250 and $540 for singles and couples, respectively. Instead, the new estimates are $200/$360. Of course, we must wait to see the long-term impact of the pandemic before finalizing the plans. So, please let’s have unity, and start preparing to attend Reunion 2021 by paying on a layaway plan or saving monthly.\n<br><br>\n<b>Charitable Seniority</b>\n<br><br>\nThe tagline of the FS-BH Schools Alumni is “Protect Our Legacy While Providing for Our Future.” However, in this current Covid-19 existence, we have decided to also provide for those to whom we owe our legacy. We feel that the survival of people in Gainesville-Hall County is an absolute higher priority than dealing with the uncertainty of post-high school training and education today. So, we are donating the funds to a productive, competent, and fruitful organization: The Sunshine Seniors.\n<br><br>\nWe will try to double the money dedicated to scholarships in the future with your additional financial support. But we are delighted to help this 501(c) 3 charter Food Pantry thrive since their clientele has doubled, but their funding remains unchanged. Since this is YOUR money as a contributor to FSBHSAA, we hope that you feel we are good custodians of your money. And we hope you will not only continue to support us financially but also donate any extra you may have to the work of Sunshine Seniors.\n<br><br>\n<b>\nSudden Impact\n</b>\n<br><br>\nBelow is an impact statement from Ms. Belinda Hailey Dickey, President of Sunshine Seniors. She welcomes your support, and we ask for your feedback.\n<br><br>\n“The Sunshine Seniors are grateful for our partnership with Fair Street Butler High Alumni Association. Over the last seven years, we have assisted our target groups of senior citizens, families with children, veterans, and the homeless. We also partner with the Georgia Mountain Food Bank, which supplies our food and goods and keeps our costs low. Due to COVID-19, many more people are facing hardships, illness, death, unemployment, insecurity, and the lack of food. The FS-BH Alumni Association has donated an additional $2,000. This donation will allow us to serve the increased number of families and individuals who come to us for food. With the epidemic, our client base has more than doubled this year compared to last year. Our normal distribution was 125 families a week, and now we are serving 280 families. We expect that number to increase to more than 300 people in the coming weeks. This generous donation provides meats, proteins, dairy, personal hygiene, and household items, in addition to the fresh fruits, vegetables, bread, and pastries we already offer. The members of The Sunshine Senior staff are all volunteers. With no overhead, every dime of assistance goes toward helping our clients. We dedicated ourselves to the health and well-being of the families that we serve. It is our pleasure to give back and to serve the Gainesville -Hall County Community. If you want to help care for families in this time of overwhelming need, mail your donations to the address below or contact us. Thank you.”",

One person stated that they would like to have a beautiful place to live and raise their children. — not a junkyard. One person stated they were trying to get Community Development to purchase the property and beautify it,” read the minutes from the November 1975 meeting.\n<br><br>\nStill, the Board of Zoning Appeals unanimously backed Loef. And over the next 20 years, as Gainesville Scrap Iron and Metal moved closer to their homes, residents cited the problems with unkempt drainage ditches, dust, rodents and noise. But almost every time, the Board of Zoning Appeals approved the industry’s expansion.\n<br><br>\nToday, Newtown residents’ requests are nearly the same as they were in November 1975.\n<br><br>\nThe community has complained for numerous years, and you’re telling me if you have any sentiment or any regard for people, at some point, somebody would have made some concessions, you know? said former Newtown resident Tyrone Sims.\n<br><br>\nBut local government officials who inherited the decades-long drama between the residents and their nearby industrial neighbors say harmony in Newtown requires them to balance the needs of the residents and the industries carefully.\n<br><br>\nNone will say, however, which weighs more: the industries that, for more than 50 years, have provided jobs and tax dollars to the community or the residents whose families have been there even longer and feel their health has been compromised by their proximity to industry.\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>A lot of problems could be fixed.</h2>\t\t\n\t\tMuch of Newtown’s fight for what residents and advocates call environmental justice has involved petitioning the state’s Environmental Protection Division to force industries to clean up their act.<br><br>\nRepresented by Greenlaw, a public interest law firm in Atlanta, the Newtown community has, over the years, brought environmental grievances to the EPDs attention.<br><br>\nBattle by battle, the community’s persistence has achieved some victories. Their continuous complaints about grain dust forced the Land O’Lakes Purina feed mill to fix faulty grain silos and resulted in greater regulation of hexane emissions, a chemical the nearby Cargill plant uses to make soybean oil.\nHowever, EPD hasn’t always enforced air quality standards with the tenacity Newtown residents would like. And with the state in a budget crisis, the agency may be even less watchful now than in the past.\n<br><br>\nEPD periodically inspects Newtown’s industries for compliance with their permits to release toxins into the air. Companies such as Cargill, which EPD considers a major source of pollution, are inspected annually. EPD inspects companies such as Purina, considered a minor source of pollution, based on complaints.<br><br>\nLately, the industries that are normally regulated by the state agency have been inspected less often because of the state’s budget deficit, said Lou Musgrove, manager of EPDs stationary source compliance program.\n<br><br>\nWe do fewer inspections because we have … three vacancies in my program, so we’ve got three less engineers to be out in the field, so that affects how many inspections we can do, Musgrove said. We haven’t eased up on enforcement when we find violations, but obviously, more field presence would be better.\n<br><br>\nBut even when the agency is fully staffed, EPD does not consider the scrap yard on Athens Street enough of a source of air pollution to require a permit. And while they can force an inspection of Purina with a complaint about grain dust, Newtown residents feel they have nowhere to go with complaints about the dust created by the junkyard, now under new ownership as Blaze Recycling & Metals.\n<br><br>\nWith the mills and things, we can always call EPD, but as far as the junkyard, its no one to call, said Faye Bush, president of the Newtown Florist Club.\nFor these reasons, advocates for the community insist that much of the issues in Newtown, the dust, the noise, and the odors of the industry will have to be remedied by local action.\n<br><br>\n“Sometimes, I don’t think people take the problems that are going on in that community as seriously as they should,” said Justine Thompson, the executive director of GreenLaw. A lot of the problems could be fixed with sufficient political will … if the city of Gainesville committed to remedying a lot of the problems there and taking it seriously, a lot of problems could be fixed.\n<br><br>\nNewtown situation calls for a more intensive political approach to environmental justice than simple state regulation, said Jamie Baker Roskie, a land use attorney with the University of Georgia.\nIn January, Roskie and other Newtown advocates asked the City Council to strengthen the city’s noise and air quality ordinances. Roskie proposed that the city establish a maximum noise level, measured by decibels, for different times of day and zoning districts. She also proposed that the city put a damper on dust emissions and require businesses that generate a certain amount of dust to create and continuously update a plan to mitigate it.",

Today, we look at the everyday lives of Newtown residents. Future stories will look at the issue from the perspective of surrounding industries and focus on the government agencies whose decisions directly impact the lives of residents and businesses.\n<br><br>\nBy Ashley Fielding\nafielding@gainesvilletimes.com\nPOSTED Dec. 6, 2009 12:02 a.m.\n5 Images 1 Video\n1 video in Multimedia.\nJust after daybreak, birds begin singing near the houses on Desota Street as they do anywhere else in Gainesville.\n<br><br>\nBut here, they must compete with a percussion of beeping backhoes, droning conveyor belts and incessant industrial fans. On cue, scrap metal crashes like cymbals.\n<br><br>\nThis melody plays only on the south side of Jesse Jewell Parkway. In a neighborhood where a grain mill towers over “green space,” next-door neighbors crush cars and chemically process soybeans.\n<br><br>\nNewtown is not your normal neighborhood; Imatean Childers was warned.\nWhen Childers moved next door to her niece, Peggy Brown, in Newtown, Brown cautioned Childers about the dust on Desota Street.\n“She was right,” Childers said, stopping for a moment from her gutter sweeping.\nAfter nearly a lifetime in the community, Brown, 61, claims she can “just about tell time” by the noises coming from the surrounding industries.\nBut dust is Browns biggest complaint.\n<br><br>\n“You dust every day. You dust every day,” Brown said. “If you gonna live in the house, you have to dust every day. … I think every lady on this street will tell you, we are constantly dusting. Thats just the way it is up here.”\n<br><br>\nThe way it is in Newtown, residential properties share boundaries with heavy industrial sites. Railcars make up the bulk of the traffic, and on hot days, the smell of soybean and grain processing is inescapable.\n<br><br>\nSuch is life in the shadow of industry a reality that is at the least a nuisance, but that some residents fear is killing them.\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>History speaks for itself</h2>\t\t\n\t\tThe issues surrounding Newtown are decades old. For 73 years, residents have watched industry after industry some of them among the countys top polluters move in next door.\n<br><br>\nIt is a predicament Nik Heynen, a professor of geography at the University of Georgia, attributes to the “spatial legacy of racism in Gainesville.”\n“Going way back, some things that were done continue to have an effect on peoples every day lives,” Heynen said. “…Well-intended people could have a healthy debate about the role of racism in todays Gainesville… I think history speaks for itself.”\nFaye Bush moved to Newtown in 1948, when the streets were dirt, the houses had no porches and segregation was the way of the world.\n<br><br>\nThe homes were built atop an old landfill east of Athens Street in the years immediately after the 1936 tornado to serve as the “New Town” for black families displaced by the disaster.\n“It wasnt anything but the land over here,” Bush said. “It wasnt no factories or anything over here, just the houses.”\n<br><br>\nAnd then came the industry. Though city zoning maps from as early as 1915 slated the areas surrounding Newtown for “suburban industrial” development, residents say not until 1954, when Purina built a mill off Athens Street, did industrial development really occur.\n<br><br>\nFive years after Purina, Prestolites Leece-Neville division opened up a starter motor production plant. Then came Cargills soybean processing facility and, soon after, a scrap-metal recycling business.\n<br><br>\n“When they first came in, we looked at it as a job for our people, so we didnt pay it that much attention until it had gotten so bad,” Bush said. “… We dealt with it. It wasnt OK, we didnt know anything about what kind of exposure it could have on you, because we didnt know anything about it.”\n<br><br>\nBush is president of the Newtown Florist Club, an innocuously-named organization that has become one of the states most venerable environmental justice groups.\n<br><br>\nThe group formed in 1950 with an initial purpose to raise money for funeral flowers. But as residents began to feel besieged by industry, club members became community watchdogs.\nIn 1978, the florist club petitioned the state Environmental Protection Division to force Purina to take care of sewage odors and fugitive grain dust that continually covered residents cars and homes.\n<br><br>\nAnd as years passed, florist club members, whose original purpose acquainted them with the causes of neighbors deaths, began to notice a trend in their neighborhood.\n<br><br>\n“We realized we were buying so many flowers,” Bush said.\nA club-sponsored survey of Desota Street residents in 1990 found that neighbors shared similar types of cancers and respiratory problems.\nThough the study was unscientific, it prompted the state health department to look into the matter. Later that year, officials from the state Department of Human Resources confirmed the higher rate of throat and mouth cancers in the neighborhood. But an investigation by Thomas McKinley, an environmental epidemiologist from the state office of epidemiology, attributed the rate of cancers to a lifestyle of smoking and drinking, according to a report he compiled for then-U.S. Rep. Ed Jenkins.\n<br><br>\nOutraged residents refuted McKinleys conclusion.\n<br><br>\n“We knew it wasnt true,” Bush said. “We had a lot of people that said the whole thing was fraud.”\nThe Citizens Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes Center for Environmental Justice analyzed McKinleys investigation in 1993. Stephen Lester, the organizations science director at the time, called McKinleys investigation “poorly designed” and “inadequate,” according to a letter he wrote to Bush.\n<br><br>\nToday, even residents who are not acutely aware of the various chemicals coming from neighboring industries blame their illnesses on industrial pollution.\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>All types of stories</h2>\t\t\n\t\t“You hear all types of stories,” said former Newtown resident Tyrone Sims. “I just know that a lot of people here have contracted cancer, you know. My mother was one of them.”\n<br><br>\nSims parents moved into their house on Harvey Street in 1949, shortly before industry began building a fortress around Newtown. His mother later died of liver cancer. His brother died of pancreatic cancer. And his uncle, also a Newtown resident, died of lung cancer.<br><br>\nSims, now 39 and a resident of Royston, remembers the childlike awareness he had of the industries next to his neighborhood.\n“You could see that dust … I remember that, you know, vividly,” Sims said.\n“But the thing that really caught my attention, you see, I was 21 years old when my mom died. I was in college at the time,” Sims said. “And you just start noticing people dying around here. And everybody was dying of cancer; it wasnt any other illnesses … it was always cancer or lupus.”\n<br><br>\nLupus is a chronic, autoimmune disease that can damage any part of the body. It has appeared in Newtown in more than one form.\nThe prevalence of lupus in Newtown is approximately six times higher than the national rate, according, to a 1997 study conducted in collaboration with the Rollins School of Public Health of Emory University.\n<br><br>\nThe same study found that lupus affects the men and women of Newtown equally; nationally, the disease occurs five times more frequently in females than in males.\nNot much is known about the cause of lupus, but researchers believe “a combination of genetics (heredity), environment, and hormones is involved,” according to the Lupus Foundation of America Web site.\nNewtown residents are convinced their environment is a key contributing factor. Maybe more than anyone, Jerome Whelchel believes that the environment in Newtown has an adverse effect on residents health.\n<br><br>\nWhelchel, a 55-year-old resident of Desota Street, lost his sister and his brother lupus in the 1960s and 1970s and his father died of lung cancer in 1992.\nHis mother, Mozetta Whelchel, a former florist club member who is Bushs older sister, is currently in a nursing home with a brain tumor.\n<br><br>\nWhelchel now lives alone in his family home on Desota Street.\n“Im the last,” Whelchel said.\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Its not regular dust</h2>\t\t\n\t\tBrown, who moved to Desota Street when she was 12, now has chronic bronchitis; her mother had asthma. She attributes both problems to Newtowns air quality.\n<br><br>\nDelinda Luster, a 63-year-old Desota Street resident, says dust sometimes blankets the area and aggravates her allergies. Lusters doctor has advised her to stop opening windows and hanging clothes outside, she said.\n“It makes you feel dirty,” Luster said. “… I cant stand here and say where its coming from, but its not regular dust.”\nLuster says that, sometimes, she feels like she can taste the dust.<br><br>\n“Sometimes, if you stay outside, when you come back in, you clean out your nose, and youd be surprised at what you got out of your nose,” Luster said. “No, it couldnt be pollen. In the wintertime, pollens not out there.”\nMore than once, but as recently as 2007, residents suspicions about dust problems were confirmed by state officials. The state Environmental Protection Division fined the nearby grain mill owned by Land O Lakes Purina $11,000 for problems with the facilitys record-keeping and for malfunctioning equipment, according to EPD enforcement records.\n<br><br>\nThe problems caused grain dust from the mill to continually “spew out” in the community, according to Ela Orenstein, an air quality and environmental justice attorney for GreenLaw.\n<br><br>\nThe 2007 enforcement order from EPD required Purina to repair the mill, but residents say dust still is occasionally a problem.\nEdith Slaughters home at the top of Emily Street is further removed from the Purina mill than her Desota Street neighbors. She says noise isnt usually a problem on the hill, but dust can be.\n“I dont think we get a whole lot up here,” Slaughter said. “But I do see it on my car, so I know if its on my car, its getting in me.”\nNothing but Newtown\nEver since industries moved in, Blondine Summerour, 71, said she is regularly awakened by the sounds of industries near to her Desota Street home.\n“Its enough that we live near a railroad track and a junk yard,” Summerour said. “You can imagine I dont know any other people that live where theres a subdivision or a community near a mill, no kind of industry. Nothing but Newtown. So it was a mistake by them building it in the first place.”\n<br><br>\nOrenstein, who represents the Newtown Florist Club along with the nonprofit environmental justice firm GreenLaw, agrees that Newtowns situation is unique.\n“The fact that the tornado came through, and that the African-American community was literally relocated on top of what used to be a municipal solid waste landfill and then was surrounded by industry theres such intention in that story that you dont find in all stories,” Orenstein said.\n<br><br>\nBut there are communities like Newtown all across the state, Orenstein said.\n“Its a historic community of color, and theyre dealing with a disproportionate burden of pollution,” Orenstein said. “And that is not necessarily a unique story in Georgia.”\nThe persistence and the cohesion of the Newtown Florist Club has attracted a number of academics to the community over the last decade.<br><br>\n“Their ability to sort of see a cohesive vision is really amazing to me,” said Jamie Baker Roskie, an attorney with the University of Georgias Land Use Clinic that works with the florist club. “They understand that … the scrap yards not their only problem; there are things that they need to do in terms of development of and cohesion of their own neighborhood in order to make their lives better, and theyve always shown a willingness to do that.”\n<br><br>\nRoskie has organized a team of researchers to tackle the many issues facing Newtown, including Heynen. Together, the group hopes to accurately assess the environmental health of Newtown and carve out a more livable community.\nBut attainment of that goal will only be possible if the group can work in cooperation with local government and state environmental regulators, Bush said. She hopes that government officials will place tighter regulations on noise and air pollution, and she hopes to see the nearby scrap-metal recycling yard become green space.\n<br><br>\n“I think as long as weve suffered in this community that we should have some green areas, walking trails for our people over here, and thats one thing that I would like to see,” Bush said.\nEarlier this year, Roskie proposed two ordinances that would regulate noise and dust emissions in the city, but Gainesville officials have yet to act.\nIn the mean time, researchers like Hynen are monitoring air quality conditions and testing the soil to see if it is safe for residents to start a community garden near Desota Park.\nThe garden is the next step in a beautification effort that the Newtown Florist Club initiated earlier this year, Bush said.\nAnd more than anything, its a sign that Newtown residents are committed to a better quality life in their community, Heynen said.\n<br><br>\n“I grew up in this neighborhood, I mean, this is what made me, thats why I come back here,” Sims said. “… Everything that I have achieved, everybody in this community is a part of.”\n<br><br>\n“Thats where I got all my values from, Newtown, and I aint going to let everybody run me out,” Sims said. “Thats what they want",

The unit is a chance for neighborhood residents to be involved in the future planning of their areas of the city.\n<br><br>\nWhen it was first formed in 2007, the Fair Street planning unit spent its first year organizing and meeting with members of various city departments and determining goals and objectives for the future of the 330-acre area situated on the city’s south side.\n<br><br>\nMost of the group’s goals are simple: Members want to protect the residential nature of the area they call home, get rid of the blight, and make others appreciate the area.\n<br><br>\nAn attempt to rezone as Neighborhood Conservation an area of the neighborhood stretching from Race Street to Fair Street is the planning unit’s first step toward those goals.\n<br><br>\nBecause of the smaller lot sizes in the neighborhood, the area is actually zoned to allow multifamily uses, such as apartments. That multifamily zoning allows some commercial uses with a special permit.\n<br><br>\nThe Neighborhood Conservation zoning the planning unit is seeking would freeze the neighborhood’s current zoning from Race Street to Summit Street and not allow any new commercial interests to establish there.\n<br><br>\n“It means that it is going to stay just like it is unless a person tears down a house,” said Gainesville Mayor Myrtle Figueras, who has been active in the rezoning effort. “If they tear it down … it has to be rebuilt as a single-family home.”\n<br><br>\nFor the past few months, the planning unit’s steering committee members have been knocking on neighbors’ doors to ask them to agree to rezone the neighborhood to keep any new businesses out.\n<br><br>\n“It is long, tedious, and hard because I tell you we’ve been working since 2007, but we have gotten 93 percent … of the people to say yes to rezone this,” Figueras said.\n<br><br>\nOf the 129 properties, at least 120 approve of the rezoning. The owners of four properties have declined, and the remaining five were not reached.\n<br><br>\nAnd since not all of the property owners in the area have agreed to the rezoning, the City Council is initiating the rezoning. Figueras filed an application on behalf of the council on Aug. 28, and the request will go before the city’s Planning and Appeals Board in October, said Gainesville’s Special Projects Manager Jessica Tullar.<br><br>\n<br><br>\nThe group hopes to do something similar in the Newtown area once the rezoning between Race and Summit streets is complete, Figueras said.\n<br><br>\n“We understand progress, but this gives us a chance to keep progress confined to a certain area,” Turner said",

Bell’s wife, Lauren, served as an Obama delegate during the 2008 election.\n<br><br>\n“I think that speaks volumes to the type of White House we have now. We’ve got a slightly younger family in there now; we have a president with eclectic tastes,” Bell said. “He is not afraid to invite people who are not your beltway insiders like me. I’m just a county commissioner from a medium-sized county in North Georgia.”\n<br><br>\nBell, a jazz fan, said he is most excited to meet the president this evening but is also looking forward to the entertainment.\n<br><br>\nHe said he hopes it also will be a good opportunity to network and put Hall County into the national conscious.\n<br><br>\n“It good to know that no matter how I got on this list that folks in D.C. know that was down here in Gainesville and that it exists, and hopefully that down the way will translate to the sort of attention and policies that reflect that towns like ours and cities like ours are not left out of the priority of the White House,” Bell said.",

She was great to work with because her goal was to ensure our children had a good foundation for going out into the world with a great education. As I see those children that went to Green Hunter Nursery as doctors, lawyers, teachers, novelists, and many other great professions, I know that it had to do with the foundation of Green Hunter Nursery under Mrs. Imogene Scott. Congratulations, Mrs. Scott, or as many children would say, (Mrs. Imogen or Mrs. Morrow) this was back in the day.",

Robert Scott, who was excited for her special day, Imogene said.\n<br><br>\n“I’ve had so many that there wasn’t much excitement,” she said about her birthday on March 31. “My husband was carrying on and telling everybody.” Many longtime Gainesville residents would know Scott by her former position as the director of Green Hunter Nursery, a position she held for 25 years. Scott began at the nursery two years after the school opened in 1952.\n<br><br>\nScott said when she was 23 she moved to Gainesville from Commerce and she later taught at the preschool briefly before attending continuing education courses at Spelman College. She then served as director until the school closed.\n<br><br>\nScott said the Green Hunter Nursery was opened because there was nowhere else for African-American children to go to preschool.\n<br><br>\n“By kindergarten they were doing the alphabet and numbers,” Scott said. “The others ladies from the (Junior Service) League would come in and teach dance. … They filled in when we needed someone.”\n<br><br>\nThe school was named for Hunter because of how instrumental he had been in the Gainesville community. Hunter founded St. John Baptist Church, served as the first moderator of the Northwestern Baptist Association and began the Northwestern School, a private school for black children.\n<br><br>\nHunter’s name appears in other places in the area, too. Green Hunter Homes was named in his honor, and now Green Hunter Homes are officially called Atlanta Street Apartments, according to the Gainesville Housing Authority.\n<br><br>\nAbout 52 children were taught each year at the nursery, which opened in October 1952. It was the first major project of the Junior Service League, now the Gainesville-Hall County Junior League.\n<br><br>\nEmory Turner, 61, began attending Green Hunter Nursery in 1952 and said the school was a big part of his success in education. Turner later worked in the manufacturing industry before retiring.\n“We learned through songs,” Turner said. “One thing that I really remember in all the classes, we performed doing skits and songs. It was a learning process … learned manners and etiquette.” Other children he went to school with went on to be doctors, lawyers and teachers.<br><br>\nTurner said he remembered Scott explaining to parents how discipline and education start at home.\n<br><br>\n“You don’t just send your child to school. … The parent has to be part of that child,” said Turner, who later attended Fair Street and E.E. Butler High Schools.<br><br>\nThe school charged parents $15 a week but closed in April 1978 because the nursery was losing money and more preschool programs were opening in Gainesville and Hall County.\n<br><br>\nWhen the Green Hunter Nursery closed its doors, Scott decided to teach children in her home.\n<br><br>\n“I ran a nursery at home,” said Scott, who has one daughter, Jackie Wade, who lives in Tuscaloosa, Ala. “I kept six children. … I had a room set up as a school.”\n<br><br>\nScott said parenting a child in school today isn’t that different. Her advice for parents today after helping hundreds of kids get a jump start on their education “I would start early helping them at home … there is just so much you can do at home to help them,” Scott said.\nThe days of working with the children at Green Hunter Nursery, she said, created memories she kept for the rest of her life.\n<br><br>\nShe said she still recalls taking the children on field trips around Gainesville, taking day trips to the lake, going to the movies or visiting other kindergarten classes.\n<br><br>\n“The kids kept me so alive,” Scott said. “The thoughts are coming back all the time.”",

What about those churches, preachers, and deacons…that’s got to be a lot of stories and history there! I am encouraging all to keep up the memories and invite others.

If she doesn’t have turkey, she uses vegetable oil, onions, celery and garlic to flavor the greens.\n<br><br>\nBut before cooking and seasoning, there is a lot of preparation.\n<br><br>\n“The main thing is you take the big stems out … a lot of people take most of the stem out, but I leave a little bit in mine because that’s where all the vitamins are,” Westbrooks said. “I roll them … if you don’t roll them, it’s harder to cut them.”<br><br>\nOnce the wide collard leaves are rolled up you can roll a few at a time Westbrooks cuts them into 1/2-inch slices. Then, the washing begins.\n<br><br>\n“Stop up your sink, run it full of water … you’re probably going to have (it) about half full of water,” Westbrooks said. “When you wash the greens you wash them four or five times because grit will be in bottom of the water,” she said. “You run your hand through the bottom of the sink to make sure its clear.”\n<br><br>\nWestbrooks, 80, and the Sunshine Seniors focus on encouraging others to eat more fruits and vegetables like collards, even though the greens take time to prepare.\n<br><br>\n“That’s where the work comes in,” she said. “The more collards you’ve got, the more water you’ll need to cover the collards.”\n<br><br>\nSome folks will recommend you add salt to the water during washing, but Southern cook Joe Edwards said you shouldn’t have to do that anymore.\n<br><br>\n“Some old-timers say put salt in the water, but remember that is what we are trying to avoid,” Edwards said. “Plenty of people would say put a little salt in the water to make the worms come up, but we aren’t dealing with worms anymore.”\n<br><br>\nAbout 40 years ago in South Florida, Edwards created his own seasoning for collards, King Louie Collard Green Seasoning.\n<br><br>\n“Its mostly bought by the new grandma and the old grandma,” said Edwards, a former caterer living in Fitzgerald, near Tifton. “That means that I have converted both sides now. You cook your greens the regular way were not trying to teach people how to cook collard greens … then shake the collard green seasoning on it.\n<br><br>\n“Its low in sodium so you are not hurting yourself.”\n<br><br>\nThe collard green seasoning has a smoky ham flavor and can be used on other vegetables, too, he said.\n<br><br>\nEdwards said greens is one of his favorite dishes now, but he wasnt fond of the vegetable for years.\n<br><br>\n“When I was coming up I hated collard greens and I called it anything wild,” Edwards said. “My father was from the country and we were from the city (Miami). He was part (American) Indian, so he lived off the land. So we used to call it anything wild. Collard greens was one of the wildest things.”\n<br><br>\nToday, collards are available at grocery stores and farmers markets and are a healthy diet option.\n<br><br>\nAccording to the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association, greens can be grown year-round and are an excellent source of vitamins A, C and E. The greens are also a great source for folic acid, beta carotene and are low in calories, fat and sodium.\n<br><br>\nhttp://www.gainesvilletimes.com/news/article/14087",

One of the things I mentioned to Jerry was the fact…if all of us would write about our experiences in Gainesville, we would, by default, write the “History of the Black Society of Gainesville/Hall County and surrounding areas.“….”The sums of all the parts would be greater than the whole“…borrowing a thought from Gestalt Psychology. We would inadvertently do something no single one of us could even attempt to accomplish alone. He agreed with me and it’s funny, but we had some of the same ideas. I told him I would speak with John about this because of the far-reaching potential. I can envision a book and maybe a movie…this could inspire someone from the community to make a movie and use people here in Gainesville as the actors. Remember, Tyler Perry is right down the street in Atlanta. You have to have a vision when you talk with me. I see things in a different light…most of the time. I see things as a “finish product.” If we draw from all of us…can’t you see all those different experiences…now put them together, and see what you come up with? I hate to say it, but you heard it first, right here! I’m encouraging everybody to write and do your part. Ask your grandchildren how to get on the computer (yes, I know we all don’t know how, but we can’t use that No. 2 pencil anymore! Smile..). Let me say this, Facebook (a social network on the internet)…is a very good social networking tool that we can use to reach out to others and it’s free!…Let’s take advantage of this technology and put our story, our history in print, just like other groups have done. Our children, one day, will be able to go to a site and see how we grew up and this will help bridge the “gap” between the generations. Some of our children just heard of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., but they don’t know the history why? I talk with young people all the time, and I am amazed at how little they know about their ancestors. Integration had a darker side to it, that we now realize, “The death of our contributions to this society “This is why you don’t see any black businesses but the barbershop, women’s hair salon, funeral home (and this is dying, thanks to Young’s and Wimberly & Jackson funeral homes) and the “Black Church”…“We shall overcome…but when…and if we did…NOBODY TOLD ME!“ I can hardly wait until the “book come out in print” We can compile these blogs and edit them for publication and this is another way to generate revenue for the Fair Street/Butler High Reunion. We could sell the book for a price mostly everybody could afford and just think how many copies people would buy. I would love to send one to Oprah and to put on her book club…people in Iowa would buy one! Can you see this? I hope this inspires you all to write and write more often…it’s all good…and none to be refused…because it’s all of our individual experiences…with this being said…”May God Bless all of us!\nRev.

We lived at first by Mr. Earnest Burns our neighbors and I stayed with “Mama Watson”, an elderly lady who pierced people ears. My sister Betty and Nathaniel were in school at the time,and one day Mama picked me up and the milk bottles was always washed. So Mama wondered why I was sleeping so much…and come to find out, “Mama Watson” had been giving me”white liquor” to keep me sleep!…Mama said “no wonder those bottles were clean everyday! I am getting a lot of this information from my sister Betty Jo and everybody knows my brother Nathaniel “Tick”, “Tickle Britches”, Montgomery. I was the baby and I remember not so muchon Summitt Street but I remember fighting Terry Jerrett all thetime on High Street. I remember that black dirt and those house you could play under. Seems like everybody had a back porch with a waterfaucet on back. We washed in those No. 2 tubs back then and we had wood stoves. I remember Mama warming water and pouring it into those tubs…and yes..my sister and I bathed in the same water. We had “curly hair” back thenMama use to use “Royal Crown” in our hair and on our faces. Boy, we went to church, “St. Paul” and that “White Holiness Church” on College Avenue. We live at R-5 on Atlanta Street and Mr. J T Shields R-1, Mrs. Alberta Banks R-2, Mr. Harold “Biscuit” Anderson R-3, Mrs. Lula Mae Singleton R-4,and Mr. & Mrs. Freddie & Polly Morton R-6 and eventually Mrs. Beatrice Mchaffany. Across thestreet Mr. “Foots”& Mrs. Fannie Riley, Mama Bell Hendrix and Mama Mize (Mr. Jalen Mize mother). Snowball used tobeat me across the street and Iused to beat him back. Fighting was the thing we did a lot of when I live on Atlanta Street. I was never scared of seemingly anybody . Iuseto go to the store for my Mama and the older guys always wanted to takemyMama change…but I was nothaving any of that. I would rather fightthan get a whipping frommy Mama. I actually think I missed my calling to be a boxer…Smile! The store was where Mr. Gene Bagwell use to give everybody on Atlanta Street an account, so that when your parents got paid, they would pay him on payday or whatever arrangement they had. We use to go and get the ends of the baloney!!!!Cookies and candy were two for a penny and I think the drinks were a dime.Oh yeah he sold Nehi orange and Grape. We use to put peanuts in the drinks and drink and eat. What about the “Rock & Rolls”, “Mary Jane”, and “Squirrels”. There was a white man that came through the projects and he sold ice cream and it’s so funny but we used to call him “The Honky Man” and when we went up to him for ice cream or popcicles,we used to say “I want a Honky!” Boy, what was we thinking?….Calling that man a “Honky” and then asking him,for a “honky.”There is no telling howmuch our parents paid Mr. Gene Bagwell, hegot rich off ofus.We use to getour clothes from Mr. Jimmie Louis and Mr. Hardy (who bought clothes from south Georgia).I remember my Mama sending me down to Mr. Jimmie Louis and telling him to give me some dressshoes, they usually cost$2.98, but He told me to go tell my Mama that, I could not wear those $2.98 shoes any more!!…my feet had grown to larger sizes. We walked, just about, every where we went.On Atlanta Street, we kids used to follow the water truck, that would come through the summer time, and wash the street off. We followed that truck allowing the water to soak us.We also followed the trash trucks and Mama whipped all of us because she had told up not to do it.We used to catch bumble bees, in aMason jar and put clover in there… What about catching”June bugs” and tying a string on them an letting them fly…There were a lot of “gnats” and “lighting bugs” back then also…”Miss Dot” used to look out that window and tell on all of us. she was the neighborhood watch. Mama Bell use to tell us not to play down in the branch and I can still hear her say “Y’all come out from down there!”I remember playing football in the streets and every now and then somebody would say “Car coming” but if we were almost getting a touchdown, we would argue each other and said “we had the touchdown before the car came too close. We rolledold car tires and I alwayswanted a “whitewall.” I finally got one and tried to keep that “whitewall” clean. Mama used to whip me for using her detergent and bringing water out of the house. I went to Green Hunter nursery and one day my sister Lois came to me and said”He bit me! I said who? I think it was Ken Reid…so I went and bit him back…right there in Nursery school. Nurse Brown use to scare us because we knew we would get shots. Ms. Morrow and Ms. Greenlee (Morehead) was the caregivers at the nursery. Weplayed on the sand box and on the sliding board and those monkey bars.One day Mama was off work but she walked my sister Lois and me to the nursery part of the way and we noticed Mama went back to the house soinstead of going on to nursery,we made that circle and went down the sidewalk behindAtlantaStreet and Lois and I were sitting on the back steps playing until somebody, Ithink Ms.Hargrove toldMama we were out there, so Mama politely took us back to nursery school!…We use to shoot marbles, make bow and arrows, and we called them “flips”…”slingshots.” We didn’t have grass back then, mostly red dirt and our parents told us to come home from school and take those clothes off. We had school clothes and Sunday “go to meeting” clothes. W e used to be “barefooted” in the summer…we used to “thump our toes” and those “flip flaps” use to always break at the toe, because we did our share of running in them…I never had a pair of All-stars back then, I always had a green bottom pair of “Pick andPay” tennis shoes. My favorite clothes Iused to wash at night and dry on the heater to wear the next day for school. I never had a lot of clothes, only “hand-me-downs” and those things from Sears, WT Grant, Mr. Hardy and Mr. Jimmie Louis.Four things I knew I could do well and that was “fight”,play “football”, “baseball/softball” and “run”We had a neighbor that kicked a can all the way to school while up Fair Street and his name was Wayne Huchinson…we called him “Stymie”…I remember CharlesCarrington Jr. telling me to hit Hilton Clark and I did…he started bleeding and I was no longer scared to fight any “Big Boy”… I had a fight with Shawn Turner and my step daddy “Willie Mason” told me…”you either whip him or I’ll whip you, so that day I whipped Shawn”…we have been friends ever since…we actually caught the”Colonial Truck”together and used to ride in the trailer eating fruits and cakes all the way to Toccoa!…Boy we were crazy back then. When we first moved to W-5 Atlanta Street, Mrs. Dorothy Turner lived at W-1, Mrs. Pauline Huchinson W-2, Mrs. Oneida Harrison W-3, Mr. & Mrs. Bullock W-4 and Mr. “Boots”& Mrs. Delma Ware W-5 and eventually Mr. Albert & Mrs. Georgia Williams. Back then, Dean Wells was in the US Army and use to come home and make his brothers and sister scrub the house down clean…we borrowed sugar, flour and anything else from each other back then…We were “Poor” and we didn’t know it!My almost whole class was on welfare, the rest of them just hid it!….Shame, Shame, Shame on you!…Everybody was on welfare or just too proud to get it. What about that cheese in those USDA boxes…Lord knows…we come a long way… What about listening to”Randy, WLAC,Nashville, Tennessee”?What about the donut man, Mr. Clyde Rakestraw!…we use to love to see him coming!….I had asecret crush on quite a few older girls back then, but I want mention them now…I would never get those old Betties off me…and my wife wouldn’t like it…Smile…I am not conceded…just confident…I come from good stock….Smile again!\nI intend to write more very soon and I hope I have notalienated people because that is not my intent…I am a lover of the truth and we have to accept truth where ever and when ever and who ever tells is. FACTS ARE ALWAYS FACTS…I always wanted to be a “Butler High Tiger” but something happen…Brownv.s. Board of Education #2…My life took a drastic turn and yes I hurt a lot of people including my wife of 32 years, I am not proud of it, but as my friend Mike Morris always say, “It is, what it is!” He’s been along with Jack and James Morris, very good friends of my family and me…I hope I get to attend this years reunion and see those people that I don’t know and that have forgot they know my family and me. Everybody knows BettyJo, Nathaniel & Lindaand Barbara Ann Stephen…maybe this year we will get to know each other.Too be continued…….Jade East…etc…GENTS CLUB….",

You are a great orator, and I wish you would use that talent to help us grow the reunion and not castigate those that left.

The only problem I have seen that no one came back to help to see that our legacy, heritage, and history were preserved. I <b><u>REMEMBER CLEANING OFF”BOOT HILL” ACROSS FROM E.E. BUTLER HIGH, NO ONE EVER CAME BACK TO CLEAR THOSE GRAVES OF OUR FOREFATHERS AND PARENTS…WHY? …NOW THEY HAVE A FOUNDATION THAT CAME IN TO HELP PAY FOR OUR GRAVES BEING CLEANED…I NEVER GOT A DIME FOR WORK? …I AM NOT ASKING FOR PAY…I JUST WONDERED WHY NO ONE EVER SHOWED UP TO INQUIRE! WE JUST GOT TO DO BETTER AS A PEOPLE AND A COMMUNITY…</b></u>I remember as a kid, my brothers and sisters coming back in their shiny cars, new clothes and some even tried to talk like they had been raised in NY or somewhere else. I have intentionally stayed away from the E.E. ButlerReunion, because I care not to see people “acting” as if they are someone else.<b><u> Now that’s my fault!</b></u> We have to learn to be real meaning coming down off the “high horses” we ride into town on. Mama told me long time ago…”<b><u>The same folks you meet on the way up, you’ll meet them on the way back down!”</b></u> Most of us left our parents only to come back later to bury them here. “Outof sight, out of mine” <b><u>We need to quit running from ourselves and the poverty we come from and make life better for our people here in Gainesville. Yeah we come from humble beginnings…but we still can be proud of it, because our parents went without, so we could have…think about it before rushing to the conclusion…I realize that everybody didn’t do this…some of us came back and did and continue to do what we can to help…</b></u>Where are my lawyers, doctors, teachers, CEO’s and other professionals that could have made this city better? I came back, and I intend to stay the course. Most of us are dying off and our time is not as long as it has been. <b><u>I have to say I am not impressed with what we are doing as a people.</b></u> I like the successes we have made, but what are they good for if we don’t start at home (Gainesville) and then spread abroad? <b><u>Charity (love)starts at home and then spreads abroad…I know I am right about it…</b></u>I tell my daughter (who happens to be a doctor), <b><u>don’t forget where you come from and reach back and help someone in this city of Gainesville.</b></u> My prayer is that I hope to raise awareness consciousness. <b><u>Please don’t be mad at me.</b></u> I may make this year’s Réunion…God willing….<b><u>“Can we just be friends?”</b></u>",

He would reach in his pocket and find a nickle coin amoung the change in his hand ond give to me. I’ve never forgotten thse few accasions. Just to share. Jim Brooks",

But I am surprised that no one has of yet mentioned the unforgettable ‘Kool Kone’! Now, THAT’S where you could get a really mean ‘slaw dog’. (Hmmm, hard to find those anymore…..} And if you have got too much ketchup on your shirt, you could always take it to ‘Kaye Cleaners’. But so much for ‘fast food’. You know that you can always find a good mess of collards, potatoes, and all kinds of good fresh vegetables on ‘Produce Row’ near downtown.\nI’ll try to venture back a bit farther. I have vague memories of a Roller-Skating Rink out of Athens Hwy on the site where the old Ball Park was near Butler School when I was knee-high to a duck. {Not like I’m hardly any taller now…….! } lol\nOf course, I read about Mrs. McCrary. Wow! That’s exciting news that she’s still with us. But when I think of her, I remember that my first encounter with her was when I first entered elementary school at ‘Northwestern Elementary School’ between Mill and Myrtle Street. I believe she was my 3rd-grade teacher before they closed down the school, and she was also the librarian.\nHey! Does anyone remember playing in the little ‘Toot Toot’ band at Northwestern Elementary School??? Now, THAT’S where I got my first interest in music!! \nIf I think hard enough, I may come up with some more, so I’ll keep pondering. You guys have brought back some very good memories. Keep it up. I do hope all of this is getting logged down somewhere.\nThanks, Debra Hood, for reminding me about Uncle Rufus’ and don’t forget about Aunt Rene’, his wife who helped run this little Mom n’ Pop store for the kids on the hill.\nNow, for us New Town old timers, I need to remind you about Mrs. Renelle Stevens’s little store. She was giving Mrs. Laura some mean competition with the ice cream. Oooooooo! My favorite there was the ‘Chocolate Ripple’.\nDebra Hood mentioned the Kiddie Campus #5, but failed to mention that before it became a daycare center, it was originally built to be a nightclub, which functioned during the day and afternoon as a hang-out for the youth who could go there and play the old pinball machines, buy snacks and dance to the old jukebox! Remember that, Debbie???\nHmmm, by George! I think it’s all coming back……………………..!",

Too long has our city commissioners chosen the path of monologue rather than that of dialogue when it comes to dealing with people and projects in the black community. It’s unfortunate we have to assemble to protest the selling of one of this community’s most treasured sites, but it’s even more unfortunate that the city power structure left the community with no alternative. Let’s go back in time a bit and look at where this community has come from and where it is now. Through the years, one can count more than fifty black-owned businesses on Athens Street, now there are less than five. The real problems as far as the community is concerned started with Urban Renewal. Many families were displaced during this period. This is evidenced by the vacant land still present in the community. The 1960 census totaled 3,819 blacks in the city, and the 1980 census showed 3,277 blacks in Gainesville, losing 542 citizens. There has to be a reason, if not a concern, for this decline. At some point during this time, a decision was made to close E.E. Butler High School, a school that had only seven graduating classes. The second, if not the first, insult to the community’s people was changing the name Athens Street to Sycamore Street. My first knowledge of this wasn’t until I saw the new street sign. Now maybe the city advertised this decision, I really don’t know, but I believe the name Green Street will never be changed because of its historical heritage. Well, what about the heritage of Athens Street and the community? Just imagine someone trying to change the names Auburn Ave., Peachtree Street, Broadway, or Fifth Ave. Next, in line with a long line of insults, was the decision to demolish the old Fair Street School building. There was a tremendous amount of history in that building, with none of it being preserved. And now, the decision has been made to sell the E.E. Butler property. I realize this building has not been used as a school for some fifteen years, but there was always hope in the community that someday, this facility would reopen as a school. Once this property is sold, there is no hope of this ever happening. The sad part is our city fathers don’t seem to care. It has always been my hope and desire that when my children and their children review Gainesville’s history, they will be able to see and read about the contributions made by this city’s black citizens. If we allow all the historical sites to be sold or destroyed, what will they have to measure our contributions by? Except for the churches in the community, one would have difficulty finding a facility with any historical value, another reason we should support our churches. Let me take note of my major disappointments with our city fathers. I have been so greatly disappointed with the city’s effort or lack of effort to keep the area residents apprised of plans for the Sycamore, Summitt, and High Street areas. The next target area of Community Development has been defined as the Summitt Street and High Street areas. Is this to have the same results that Urban Renewal had? Keep in mind that these two areas are continuing links to the area presently being developed commercially. You could draw a conclusion about this from other developments in the community. With all the development going on in the community, I think the commissioners should explain the plans for the community, especially the Atlanta Street area. I would be the last person to oppose progress, but I oppose it at the expense of and displacement of the community’s residents. Why should we be any less concerned with what goes on in our community as those who oppose The Presidential Parkway, the Plantation Development, or Union Carbide? People, we can ill-afford to wait any longer to take a stand on the selling of the E.E. Butler Property and other issues facing our community, for our wait almost always means never. One day Gainesville will recognize its’ black citizens that contributed so mightily to its history. There will be people like Beulah Rucker, George Stephens, Dr. E.E. Butler, Clara B. McCrary, and Mattie Moon. But until that recognition comes, we must have a reminder such as the E.E. Butler High School Building shining as a beacon light to remind our city fathers of Our Glorious Past.",

Raw chicken, when processed takes up a lot of water. This robs it of its natural flavor. Soaking in salt water overnight, it regains flavor. The real trick is how much salt? He would not let me see that one. I had to work it out by trial and error. The old ones always had ways to make you think/learn.<br><br>\nI was @ Ms. Imagene Neal Morrow, now Scott’s home, a few weeks ago. She holds an archive of photos of The Green Hunter Nursery. If I am treated properly, I will get us copies. Ha! Ha! Ha!",

We have been mourning for the past few months, yet we have been filled with gratitude. While we have mourned the loss of my father, we are filled with gratitude for the 90 years of his life. We are also filled with gratitude for the outpouring of love that has been shown to him by his players, students, and friends.\n<br><br>\nWe have been made aware that it appears that a movement spearheaded by my father’s players and students to have a venue named in his honor is going to come to fruition. We would like to thank everyone who was involved in this initiative, and we would also like to thank everyone for all of the kind words, thoughts, and deeds that have made this difficult time more bearable. Thank you all for everything that you have done.\n<br><br>\nSincerely,\n<br><br>\nShelley Cabbell",

Cabbell and Assistant Coach Willie S. Dinkins, the Tigers completed one 12-1 season and finished another season undefeated (12-0).\n<br><br>\nDuring the 1956 campaign, the Tigers rolled to a string of victories which included the first five games where no opponent even scored on them.\n<br><br>\nOn September 1, the Tigers began their 1956 season with a shutout win over Summer Hill High of Cartersville 8-0.\n<br><br>\nOn September 7, 1956 Lemon Street High of Marietta, fell 9-0.\n<br><br>\nOn September 29, Booker High School of Barnesville was the victim of a 35-0 Tigers victory. Eugene Carrithers and Clifford Stephens scored touchdowns on the ground; Quarterback Cecil Young passed for three touchdowns, 2 to Arthur Moss covering 40 and 35 yards, respectively, and a 25-yard strike to Eddie Strickland. Defensively, the Tigers were led by Willie Ed Stephens, Clarence Niles, Leonard Deadwyler, John Keith, and Cluster Smith. Eugene Carrithers rushed for more than 100 yards on the night.\n<br><br>\nOctober 4th was a very significant night for the Tigers. They were carrying a 4 game-winning streak into a game against an opponent they had never defeated, Cedar Hill High School of Cedartown. Cedartown was the Defending State Champions from 1955. Unfazed by the challenge, and on Cedar Hills Home field, the Tigers got their first-ever win over Cedartown by a score of 6-0. Cecil Young passed 40 yards to Arthur Moss for the lone score in the game’s first 2 minutes. Although neither team could mount much offense the rest of the way, Eugene Carrithers was the bright spot on offense for either team, churning out tough yards. Defensively the Tigers were lead by Clarence Niles, Thomas Carter, John Keith, David Camp, and Cluster Smith.\nThis game took on another significant revenge factor. In 1955 the Tigers advanced to their first North Georgia Championship game only to lose to Cedartown. Something special was brewing in Tigerland!! Through five games, the Tigers were not only undefeated; no one had crossed their goal line.\n<br><br>\nOn October 12, the Tigers met Bruce Street High of Lithonia at City Park. Another impressive victory was led by the High-scoring Tigers offense, the Stingy, and sometimes Nasty Defense. The Tigers defeated Lithonia by scoring 41-0 on two touchdowns each by Eugene Carrithers and Eddie Strickland (receptions from Cecil Young) and a touchdown by Clifford Stephens. David Camp was good, kicking 5 of 6 extra points. Defensively, the Tigers were led by Fletcher Johnson, Cluster Smith, Thomas Carter, Clarence Niles, John Keith, and Arthur Moss. This marked the sixth consecutive game that the Tigers held their opponent scoreless.\n<br><br>\nOn October 19, the Tigers met H.B. Henderson High of Jackson at City Park. The Tigers defeated Jackson 46-18, surrendering the first scores to an opponent to this point of the season. In this win, Clifford Stephens scored four touchdowns on runs of 70, 15, 6, and 40 yards. Eugene Carrithers scored two touchdowns on a run of 35 yards and a 95-yard kickoff return. A 30-yard touchdown run by Carrithers was nullified by a penalty. Cecil Young passed 30 yards to Arthur Moss for another touchdown. David Camp was good on 5 of 7 extra-point kicks.\n<br><br>\nOn October 27th, the Tigers celebrated Homecoming by defeating Elberton 27-13 for their 8th consecutive victory. This game marked the first time of the season that the Tigers trailed in a game as Elberton got off to an early 6-0 lead. Two touchdowns by Clifford Stephens and Eugene Carrithers carried the Tigers to victory. Carrithers first touchdown marked his first touchdown reception of the season. David Camp was good on 3 of 4 extra point attempts. Thomas Carter, David Camp and Clarence Niles lead the defensive charge for the Tigers. In addition to winning Homecoming and keeping the win streak alive, this game qualified the Tigers for the Regional Championship Game.\n<br><br>\nOn November 2nd, 1956, the Tigers lost their only game of the season, a 6-0 defeat to Greensboro. Greensboro was undefeated and un-scored like the Tigers through their first six games. Outstanding defense by both teams highlighted the game. The Tiger’s defensive standouts were Clarence Niles and Cluster Smith.\n<br><br>\nOn November 16th, 1956, the Tigers hosted the Rams of Thomson, Ga., for the Region II Championship. Before the Rams could register its first tackle of a Tigers Player, the score was 20-0. The scoring started with Eugene Carrithers returning the opening kickoff 90 yards for a score. On the Tiger’s next series, Clifford Stephens ran 76 yards for a score. On Thomson’s next series, David Camp broke through to block a Rams punt. Camp picked up the loose ball and ran in for a touchdown. With outstanding offense provided by the running of Carrithers, Stephens, Charles Christian, Eddie Strickland, Ellis Cantrell, Cecil Young and Arthur Moss, the Tigers held a 39-0 halftime lead and went on to defeat Thomson by a score of 53-0 for the Region II Title.\n<br><br>\nHaving won the Region II Championship, the Tigers had to await the outcome of the Region I championship to be played between Rockmart and Cartersville. During this off week, Coach Cabbell agreed to play in a Lions Club benefit game against Decatur. This game would benefit the Lions Club Lighthouse for the Blind Fund. This was another Tigers victory (53-0 by newspaper accounts). Fortunately, the only injury in the Decatur game was a cut lip on quarterback Cecil Young.\n<br><br>\nFair Street Tigers Win North Georgia Championship\n<br><br>\nOn December 7, 1956, the Tigers met Cartersville for the North Georgia Championship. The game was played in Cartersville and marked the second time this year the teams met. The Tigers defeated Cartersville earlier in the season by a score of 8-0. In the championship game, the Tigers prevailed by a score of 15-7. All scoring was done in the first half. The Tigers tallied first as David Camp nailed a punt out of bounds at the Cartersville 1-yard line. The defense held and forced Cartersville to punt. As the Cartersville Punter started his punt motion, he accidentally stepped on the end line for a safety and a 2-0 Tigers lead. Ellis Cantrell broke loose for a 55-yard run to the Cartersville 5-yard line. From there, Ellis carried into the end zone for an 8-0 lead going into the second period. Cecil Young found Arthur Moss in the Cartersville end zone and hit him with a strike for a touchdown. David Camp added the extra point, and the Tigers had a 15-0 lead. Cartersville scored just before halftime and trailed 15-7. The second half was a defensive battle, with both squads playing outstanding defense.\n<br><br>\nTigers Take Their First State High School Football Championship\n<br><br>\nOn December 14th, the Tigers met The Longhorns of Claxton, Ga., for the State Championship at City Park. Led by the running of Eugene Carrithers, Clifford Stephens, and Ellis Cantrell and the passing combination of Cecil Young and Arthur Moss, the Tigers jumped off to a 20-0 halftime lead and never looked back on their way to a 27-0 victory. Eugene Carrithers set up the first score by running 22 yards to the Longhorns 3 yard line. Ellis Cantrell ran the final 3 yards for the touchdown.\n<br><br>\nAfter David camp recovered a Claxton fumble deep in their territory, Quarterback Cecil Young ran two straight sneaks for another score and a 14-0 lead.\n<br><br>\nOn the ensuing kickoff, a Claxton Player fumbled the kickoff twice. He then kicked the ball into the end zone and let it lay. Two alert Tigers, Thomas Carter and David Camp, recovered the free ball in the end zone for another score and a 20-0 halftime lead. Eugene Carrithers ended the scoring by returning a punt 78 yards for a touchdown. Another Tigers score, a 33-yard touchdown run by Clifford Stephens, was nullified by a penalty.\n<br><br>\nThis game marked the Tiger’s first State High School Championship (Class B) and gave them an overall 12-1 record.\n<br><br>\nThe 1957 Season\n<br><br>\nIn 1957 Fair Street moved up to Class A. The Tigers were anxious to begin play, but disappointedly had their first game postponed because of a scheduling conflict in the Marietta School System.\n<br><br>\nReturning 10 of 11 starters from the 1956 championship year, the Tigers were ready.\n<br><br>\nThe Tigers started a roll-on on September 14, 1957, and The Tigers began the defense of their state Championship by defeating Lemon Street High School of Marietta by a score of 26-0. Tigers roll on September 19; The Tigers defeated East Depot High School of LaGrange by a score of 14-0. Building steam\n<br><br>\nOn September 27, The Tigers defeat F.B. Henderson High of Jackson in a 6-0 slugfest. This game marks the fourth straight shutout for the Tigers. Tigers remain undefeated and un-scored on.\n<br><br>\nTigers surrender the first score of the season.\n<br><br>\nOn Saturday, October 5, The Tigers defeated Henry County Training School of McDonough by a score of 24-14, marking the first team to cross the Tigers goal line this season.\n<br><br>\nStarting a new shutout string<br><br>\nOn Thursday, October 10, The Tigers met Carver High School of Carrollton. The Tigers successfully defeated Carrollton by a score of 38-0, starting a new scoreless string for its opponents.\n<br><br>\nBuilding upon the streak\n<br><br>\nOn Friday, October 18 the Tigers traveled to Elberton to meet Blackwell Memorial. This marked another successful trip as the Tigers came away with a 50-0 win.<br><br>\nSweet Revenge\n<br><br>\nOn Friday, October 25, The Tigers were ready for a little payback. Greensboro registered the only blemish on the Tigers record in the 1956 season with a 6-0 win. In this contest, Eugene Carrithers returned the opening kickoff 80 yards for a touchdown. The Tigers proceeded to outplay the Greensboro team and win 20-6.\n<br><br>\nThe streak continues\n<br><br>\nThursday, October 31, The Tigers hosted Bruce Street High of Lithonia and trounced them by the score of 46-0.\nStill going\nThursday, November 7, The Tigers traveled to Decatur to play Arch-Rival Trinity High. We all know what to expect when we visit Decatur. Does anyone wonder why we always lost the fight in Decatur but were never allowed to return the favor when they visited us? The Tigers won the game 12-0, but I think the band had a cold ride back to Gainesville, courtesy of the Decatur Fans. This game marked the end of the regular season (9-0) and launched The Tigers into the Regional Final.\n<br><br>\nTigers win Region II Championship.\n<br><br>\nOn Thursday, November 21, The Tigers defeated Main High of Rome by a 15-0 at City Park. This marked The Tiger’s 8th shutout in 10 games this season, the 3rd straight shutout since the 20-6 win over Greensboro. This also marked the 14th consecutive win since the loss to Greensboro on November 2, 1956.\n<br><br>\nTigers win North Georgia Championship.\n<br><br>\nOn Saturday, December 7, The Tigers traveled to Fort Valley to play Hunt High for the North Georgia Championship. In a hard-fought contest, The Tigers emerged successful, a 7-6 defeat of Hunt High School to win its second consecutive North Georgia Championship. (The lone touchdown by the Tigers was scored on a run by Marshall Carter. Ellis Cantrell scored the deciding extra point on a dive off right guard).\n<br><br>\nTwo in a row\n<br><br>\nOn Friday night, December 20, The Tigers of Fair Street High met Douglas High School of Thomasville for the State Championship. The two teams played to a 7-7 tie through three and a half quarters. The Tigers opened the scoring on a 19-yard pass from Quarterback Cecil Young to Arthur Moss. The play was set up by a 20-yard punt return by Ellis Cantrell. Ellis also carried over for the point after and a 7-0 lead.\n<br><br>\nThomasville got on the scoreboard on a series of keepers by Quarterback Charlie Ward and a two-yard plunge by Halfback Roosevelt Reed for the touchdown. Ward carried on a keeper for the point after to knot the score at 7-7 at the half.\n<br><br>\nWith 3:40 left to play, Eugene Carrithers broke through the line on a cross-buck for 6 yards and the final score (13-7). The Tigers had their second consecutive State Championship.\n<br><br>\nIn its first year of competition in Class A, the Tigers took the State Crown. A foot note on the 1957 championship game, the quarterback for Thomasville was Charlie Ward, father of the standout quarterback for the Florida State Seminoles and 1993 Heisman Trophy Winner.\n<br><br>\nAccomplishments:\n<br><br>\nIn first 4 games of 1956 Tigers outscored opponents 66-0\nIn 2 straight years (56 &amp; 57), the Tigers shutout the first 4 opponents\nAfter losing 6-0 to Greensboro on November 2, 1956, the Tigers went on to play 23 straight games without a loss dating to November 13, 1958\n25-1 record over a 2-season period\nBack-to-back State Championships\n1956 only 3 of 9 regular season opponents scored on them\n1957 only 2 of 9 regular season opponents scored on them\nThus, the 1956 and 1957 Georgia State Championship Teams remain the only public high school in the city of Gainesville to win a State Championship. They are the only public high school in Hall County to win back-to-back State Championships.\nAsk members of Championship Teams to stand at the podium!!To the members of the teams from 1956 and 1957, on behalf of this Fair Street-Butler High School Reunion, we salute you!!

They were honored and recognized at the first season game between Gainesville High and Chestatee on Friday, August 28, 2009. They walked out with pride wearing the maroon hats reflecting 56 & 57 Championship Teams at half-time, a very memorable moment that touched all who attended our all-Black schools, which no longer exist. The next weekend rolled around, and the reunion began. They were recognized again by Larry & Jerry Castleberry during intermission at the Prom, where “our boy’s gone shine tonight” was played and sung with pride. They were strong in attendance and represented the team and our school well. Saturday night, during intermission at the Sock Hop, they were still standing strong, cameras were flashing, and all came and stood among the masses of fellow classmates, a memory that will reflect in their minds for a lifetime. Sunday was the climax of the Closing Ceremony. Larry Castleberry took us back down memory lane with a speech that reminded some, enlightened others, and took others to a place they wished they had been more than 50 years ago. They were recognized again and congratulated again and again. Well, this Friday, September 25, 2009, at 1:00 p.m. at Fair Street School, where it all began, they will again be recognized with a lasting monument that will be placed in a permanent space that will live on for an eternity. Mr. Will Campbell, principal of Fair Street School, has said, “this is the place that should mark the achievements of the 56 & 57 Championship Football Team because this is where it all began,” and to this, we say, “Thank You,” Principal Campbell. It took a while but it has finally come full circle after more than 50 years. We also would like to “Thank” Jerry Castleberry for birthing this idea, Emory Turner for working tirelessly to pull all information together, and Kim Paul for making the event with the hats and invitations so memorable. And last but not least, “Thanks” to the entire Board for making this one of the most memorable reunions ever.\n<br><br>\nTheresa Anderson-Puryear\n<br><br>\nFSBH – Alumni Secretary & Class of 1967.",

I am proud of those who organized this event and even prouder of those who took time out of their busy schedules to attend. Already I am hearing people talk about the next reunion. A big thank you to those new board members that agreed to serve on the board for the next reunion. The focus on the championship football teams added much excitement to this event. It’s my hope that such recognition will become a regular staple for future reunions. Fair Street and Butler High Schools have so much history that has never been told. I would encourage everyone to contribute a historical post by someone or something from the school. Listening to the speech given by the speaker at the reunion inspired me to hear about others that walked thru the doors of Butler and Fair Street. People, we were ahead of our time. We had great people, not just athletes. I would like to hear about them. Since I have put out the challenge, I will start with the first story. Few realize that Carlton (Bunny) Brown was a world-class athlete at Morehouse College. I understand that Carlton still holds a track record at the school. Carlton preceded Edwin Moses at Morehouse. Carlton competed against other notable athletes such as Bob Hayes and Bob Paramore from Florida A & M University. Bob Hayes was once rated the world’s fastest human and was a star with The Dallas Cowboys. Carlton was also a teammate of Arthur Walker, who competed in the triple jump in the Olympics. To all of you that represented our community, I say thank you.",

Quarterback Michael Vick was recently reinstated by the National Football League and signed by the Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles organization showed excitement for his arrival because he brings an explosive and unique game to the Pennsylvania City of Brotherly Love.\nMany Philadelphia citizens and Eagle fans didn’t show much love, saying Vick blew his chance with his more-than-frowned-upon actions.\nStill, the decision was made by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to allow Vick to play. Nothing can be done, that is, to remove Vick from the league.\nBill Smith, CEO and founder of Main Line Animal Rescue in Philadelphia, found a way for Eagle fans to encourage Vick to be on the gridiron but not to win.\nSmiths’ idea involves running a series of anti-Vick advertisements. The first was planned to run in Sept. 9s, Washington Post. A copy was sent to ESPN, the Eagles, and several animal rights groups. It reads:\nAttention, football fans. Philadelphia is playing Washington on October 26th. Every time Michael Vick is tackled during the game, Main Line Animal Rescue will donate five bags of dog food to your local animal shelter.\nWe feel guilty sending Michael Vick to other cities; Smith told ESPN. Maybe it’s our way of apologizing for bringing Michael Vick onto our team.\nSimilar ads will run in cities the Eagles visit. Smith plans to install billboards near Lincoln Financial Field, the Eagle’s home turf.\nGood for Bill. He’s helping benefit man’s best friend by encouraging players to tackle and possibly injure him, a prolific athlete who has paid his dues and continues to apologize and make public appearances.\nLet the man play. He made a mistake; we all do. Why aren’t the other participants of that violent night being harassed? Oh, because Vick is a public figure and makes millions. He’s a human being who deserves a second chance.\nBesides, he and the Eagles are already taking action on the subject with broadcast-based campaigns to fight animal cruelty.\nI’m not sure Eagle fans understand what Vick brings to the table. Are they aware that he set the record for rushing yards by a quarterback in 2006? Do they know he holds the NFL record for most yards per carry in that same season? Have they discovered that he’s the first quarterback to pass for 250 yards and rush for 100 in the same game in 2004? I doubt it.\nNaysayers need to let him perform. If he winds up being a bust, bash him. But it will be funny to see Vick shine. I look forward to the moment when the Eagles organization says, we told you so.",

First story: Michael Vick, who once upon a time was the star quarterback of the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League, was charged two years ago with dog fighting.\n<br><br>\nI do not understand why anyone in his right mind would get enjoyment from watching two dogs try to kill each other. And I cannot understand why anyone would want to train dogs to do such a thing.\n<br><br>\nAccording to evidence found on Vick’s property, there were 53 animals there, many of them scarred and maimed because they were used as cannon fodder for the champion dog fighters.\n<br><br>\nI own a dog, a miniature, long-haired female dachshund. She is the joy of my life and makes me laugh every single day. She is not a fighter. I cannot imagine wanting to do anything to harm her. And I certainly would not want anyone else trying to do it, either.\n<br><br>\nAbout 31/2 years ago, when she was a youngster, I could not break her habit of chasing cars. She was struck by the mailman and had blood all over the side of her face. I never had heard a dog scream like that.\n<br><br>\nIt turned out her cuts were small. She was like her owner, a breeder.\n<br><br>\nShe has not chased any more cars. She is smart.\n<br><br>\nThat’s what normal animal owners do when their animals are hurt. Take care of them. They do not put them in situations where they can be hurt, maimed or killed.\n<br><br>\nSo, Vick was in a heap of trouble.\n<br><br>\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) were up in arms, as were all animal lovers. I would not call myself a true animal lover, but I love my dog and certainly do not believe in being cruel to any animals.\n<br><br>\nVick admitted his guilt and was convicted and sentenced to two years (he served 23 months) in prison at Leavenworth, Kan. Leavenworth is not a country club. Also, he lost millions of dollars.\n<br><br>\nHe just signed to play football again (with the Philadelphia Eagles). Many people feel he should not be given a second chance.\n<br><br>\nI am not one of them.\n<br><br>\nI am not a Vick fan. What he did was despicable and unimaginable. But he served his time. He took his medicine, and it cost him dearly.\n<br><br>\nSecond story:\n<br><br>\nDonte Stallworth is a wide receiver for the Cleveland Browns. He earns $5 million per year.\n<br><br>\nLast winter, he was drinking and allegedly smoking pot at a Miami night spot. His partying lasted until dawn. And at 7 a.m., he was drunk driving his car and struck a pedestrian crossing a causeway in a crosswalk. The man was killed.\n<br><br>\nThe victim, 59, a crane operator, was on his way home from work. He was a husband and father.\n<br><br>\nStallworth’s blood alcohol level was way over the legal limit. He pleaded guilty to DUI manslaughter. Actually, it was DUI vehicular manslaughter.\n<br><br>\nStallworth insisted he honked his horn, flashed his headlights to warn the man, and drove only 40 miles an hour. Yeah, and he had only two drinks.\n<br><br>\nStallworth’s lawyers claimed the man contributed to his own death because he was jaywalking. Can you believe that? The victim just jumped out in front of Stallworth’s car.\n<br><br>\nThe wide receiver faced 15 years in prison and the end of his career. That did not happen.\n<br><br>\nWhat happened was his attorneys somehow worked out a financial settlement with the victim’s family, and a judge sentenced Stallworth to 30 days in jail and community service. Stallworth served 24 of those 30 days and was released.\n<br><br>\nA summation and an opinion:\n<br><br>\nTwo years in prison, the loss of millions of dollars for killing dogs.\n<br><br>\nTwenty-four days in jail, a financial deal with the family for killing a human being.\n<br><br>\nI do not condone what either man did. What they did was horrific … but am I the only one who sees something wrong with this?\n<br><br>\nContact retired Daily Mail sports editor Bill Smith at bs.i…@yahoo.com.",

But asked about the only blemish on his record Hendrix suffered a four-round draw in his debut its clear hes still upset the decision didnt go his way.\n<br><br>\n\"They robbed me of that fight,\" Hendrix (16-0-1) said. \"It was just one of those moments where you got robbed in somebodys hometown.\"\n<br><br>\nHes determined not to let it happen again, and hes left no doubt in the minds of judges and fans ever since.\n<br><br>\nFighting between 134 and 144 pounds, the 28-year-old Hendrix has shredded opponents, scoring six knockouts and overwhelming foes with superior precision to notch nine wins by unanimous decision.\n<br><br>\nHendrix credits his success to quickness, footwork and conditioning, and says hell need to exploit his advantages in all three Friday when he takes on 23-year-old Missourian Robbie Cannon (12-3-1, six knockouts), possibly one of his toughest opponents yet.\n<br><br>\n\"Im looking at this guy as a dangerous guy,\" Hendrix said. \"Ive seen him fight and hes pretty crafty, so Ive got something to look forward to.\"\n<br><br>\nHendrix said sticking to a game plan will be crucial to his success. For the lefthander, that means doing the simple things well.\n<br><br>\n\"I just need to do my thing and not make the fight harder than I need to,\" Hendrix said. \"Ive been working on the fundamentals and really just the basics. With me being a southpaw, its going to be harder on him to catch up with me.\"\n<br><br>\nFriday marks a return to Tunica for Hendrix, who earned a win by unanimous decision there over veteran Phillip Payne in March. Though Payne entered the fight against Hendrix with a losing record for his career, Hendrixs last four wins came against boxers with a combined record of 63-16.\n<br><br>\nHendrix believes his ability to comfortably go the distance in any fight has made the biggest difference at this point in his career.\n<br><br>\n\"A lot of fighters that have been undefeated have taken steps up, but couldnt pass the test,\" he said. \"And Ive been taking steps early in my career and fighting guys with big records and passed the test. I think (my endurance) is what separates me. I train hard. I feel like I train harder than anybody in Georgia.\"\n<br><br>\nCannon enters the weekend as a loser in three of his last five fights, due largely to increasingly tough competition. His three losses have come against Ira Terry (22-2), NABO featherweight champ Rafael Valenzuela (13-1) and Leon Bobo (18-3).",

As you may recall Phil Jackson wrote about the 1957 championship game in an article that was posted in the Times on December 22nd, 1957. Phil touted the Tigers Players Gene Carrithers, Arthur Moss, Clarence Niles, David Camp, John Keith, William Johnson, Ellis Cantrell, Cecil Young, Clifford Stephens, and Coach E.L. Cabbell.\n<br><br>\nPhil was also impressed with the outstanding play of some of the Douglas High Lions players from Thomasville, Ga. One player, in particular, caught my attention: the quarterback Thomasville, Charlie Ward. Well, I was curious and looked into it a little deeper. Charlie Ward is the father of the 1993 Heisman Trophy winner from Florida State, Charlie Ward Jr.  As you know, Charlie Jr. went on to play in the NBA before retiring a few years ago. I was able to speak with Charlie Jr. to confirm that it was indeed his father that quarterbacked the Thomasville team that the Tigers defeated for the 1957 championship; small world!!",

Butler High School. \n<br><br>\nLinks are provided to their pages on the Wall of Faces.  “Remembrances” gives you the opportunity to share stories about them.  We know how they died.  Your stories will show how they lived.   \n<br><br>\nForrest Goudelock\n<br><br>\n1942 – 1968\n<br><br>\nhttp://www.vvmf.org/Wall-of-Faces/19379/FORREST-GOUDELOCK\n<br><br>\nHe graduated from Fair Street HS, worked for a year and joined the Army in October 1963.  In 1964, while he was stationed in Germany, he married his high school sweetheart, Kathryn Render, and she went to live with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Clyde Goudelock, at 438 Copeland Street.  \n<br><br>\nHe arrived in Vietnam on October 26, 1967, and served with Company E, 3rd Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment, 9th Infantry Division. \n<br><br>\nOn April 19, 1968, during enemy action in Dinh Tuong province, Sgt. Goudelock was killed by small arms fire. \n<br><br>\nHe is the recipient of two Bronze Star Medals and the Purple Heart, is buried in Timber Ridge Cemetery, and his name is located on Panel 50E, Line 47 of the Vietnam Wall.\n<br><br>\nWilbur Mattox\n<br><br>\n1944 – 1968\n<br><br>\nhttp://www.vvmf.org/Wall-of-Faces/33067/WILBUR-F-MATTOX\n<br><br>\nArmy Private First-Class Wilbur Mattox was married to Constance Mattox, who lived at 530 Race Street.  The couple had one son.  PFC Mattox was a member of the Army’s Americal Division.   On April 24, 1968, during a patrol in Thua Thien province, he was struck by fragments from a mine explosion.  He was evacuated to an Army field hospital, but his wounds were so extensive, he died the next day, April 25.  He reported for duty in Vietnam on February 25, a short two months earlier.  PFC Mattox is the recipient of the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.  He and his wife, who passed away in 2015, are buried next to each other in Alta Vista Cemetery, Block AC, Lots 30 and 31. His name is engraved on Panel 52E, Line 8 at the Vietnam Wall.\n<br><br>\nJohnny Bill Robertson, Jr.\n<br><br>\n1946 – 1969\n<br><br>\nhttp://www.vvmf.org/Wall-of-Faces/43848/JOHNNY-B-ROBERTSON-JR\n<br><br>\nJohnny Bill lived with his mother, Willene, and his sister, Joyce, at 240 Atlanta Street, Apartment A-1.  His father was deceased.  He joined the Army and arrived in Vietnam on May 15, 1969, assigned to the 9th Infantry Division. \n<br><br>\nHe went swimming in a river 5 kilometers east of Ham Long village in Kien Hoa province.  The official reports lack detail, other than he drowned before help could arrive.  One possibility is that his outfit had been out on patrol, some soldiers went into the river to cool off, and he followed them in.  Johnny Bill’s swimming abilities may have been weak or non-existent.  Had he meant to stay near the riverbank and slipped into a deep hole?  We’ll never know.  What we do know is he died on June 8, 1969, three weeks after he arrived in Vietnam.\n<br><br>\nHe’s the recipient of the Bronze Star and is buried in Alta Vista Cemetery, Block AC, Lot 53.  His name is on Panel 23W, Line 114 of the Vietnam Wall. \n<br><br>\nCarl Lee Thornton\n<br><br>\n1937 – 1971\n<br><br>\nhttp://www.vvmf.org/Wall-of-Faces/51957/CARL-L-THORNTON\n <br><br>\nFollowing his studies at Fair Street High School, Carl Lee joined the Army with plans to make it his career.  He was married and in his second decade of military service.  His successful career as a Food Service Specialist was advancing him into senior enlisted status, as evidenced by his promotion to Staff Sergeant (E-6).  He was the recipient of two Bronze Stars and the Good Conduct Medal.  He reported for duty in Vietnam on July 15, 1971.  On November 28, he was aboard an Army helicopter CH-47C, commonly known as a Chinook, for a troop lift from Da Nang to Phu Bai.  Bad weather and poor visibility resulted in the Chinook crashing into a mountain.  36 died in the crash, including Army Staff Sergeant Carl Lee Thornton.  He’s buried in the Mt. Zion Baptist Church cemetery.  His name is located on Panel 2W/Line 80 of the Vietnam Wall.  \n<br><br>\nGeorge Lamar Young<br><br>\n     1947 – 1968 <br><br>                                                               http://www.vvmf.org/Wall-of-Faces/57843/GEORGE-L-YOUNG\n<br><br>\nLamar was assigned to B Company, 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, an element of the legendary 1st Cavalry Division.  The objective of Operation Sheridan Sabre was to prevent elements of the North Vietnamese Army massed in Cambodia from entering South Vietnam.  In a significant and fierce firefight northwest of Tay Ninh City, Lamar’s unit fought courageously against a battle-hardened NVA force.  Lamar and eight of his brothers-in-arms died in the fight, but they didn’t go quietly.  Army documents show that Lamar’s outfit killed 138 of the enemy.  He is the recipient of the Bronze Star, the Air Medal, and the Purple Heart.  His name is located on Panel 38W, Line 62 of the Vietnam Wall. \n<br><br>\nJoin the Forum discussion on this post",

I, Linda Delores, the oldest retired after three decades of helping our children succeed. My siblings are Benjamin Lavar, a prominent Augusta physician; Bobbie Jean, a summa cum laude Psychology/ Health Sciences graduate and insurance career retiree; Walter James, a highly respected Gainesville attorney; Jonathan Lowell, a Georgia Tech trained engineer and owner of an Engineering Consultancy.\n<br><br>\nI have often been asked why and how we were able to excel. Since I have been asked to write an article, this summarizes our success story.\n<br><br>\nI believe that our accomplishments can be attributed to the following basic factors:\n<br><br>\nGod our Creator, who through His grace blessed us with certain academic abilities and\nskills.\n<br><br>\nA non-negotiable set of morals and values instilled in us by parents who loved and supported us.<br><br>\nA home, school, and community environment which nurtured developed, and promoted our talents and abilities.<br><br>\nThis article explains how God, our parents, and our community brought us this far.\n<br><br>\nNone of us can create ourselves or select our parents. Therefore, we cannot take credit for any of the attributes, talents, or abilities we possess. It is true that we often inherit various traits from our parents, but they, too were created beings and not the original creator of life. We were blessed with academic abilities and good parents. We are grateful and thank God for both blessings.\n<br><br>\nBoth of our parents graduated from Fair Street High School. Daddy graduated as the valedictorian of his 1940 class. Our mom graduated in 1946. Both had their aspirations of attaining higher educations interrupted by life. Like many young men, Daddy served in the Pacific during World War II. Upon being discharged, he enrolled in Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia through the G.I. Bill as a business major. Momma’s secretarial training at National Business College in Nashville, Tennessee was cut short as she returned to care for her ill mother… So when my future daddy returned from Morehouse, he and my future momma met, fell in love and married in 1947. Daddy returned to Morehouse as a sophomore. As fate stepped in, I was born on June 6, 1948. My paternal grandmother became ill and my dad gave up his Morehouse dream and a college degree to support and provide for his new family.\n<br><br>\nYet, a great foundation was laid for that family’s future. Although our parents put aside their career dreams, they began to pass those dreams and expectations on to us, their children. One of my first memories as a child of three is of my father saying, “My girls will go to Spelman and my boys will go to Morehouse.” Dr. Benjamin Mays, then president of Morehouse College had made an indelible impression on daddy and he sometimes quoted and talked about him.  It is ironic that all of us graduated from college, but none of us ever attended Morehouse or Spelman.\n<br><br>\nDaddy and Momma had a few ironclad rules. One of these rules was that if you remained in their household or under their roof, you would finish high school. You would not be given a choice. They also made it clear that their preference was for you to attend college following high school. They did not demand that you attend college, but they made sure to plant the seeds of expectations deeply within us.\n<br><br>\nI don’t ever remember Momma or Daddy ever discussing how we would pay for college educations. As children, we were naïve enough to believe that if they said we could and would go to college, then we could and would go. Although our parents didn’t always attend their membership churches regularly, they were believers and had faith in God. Momma always said, “The Lord will make a way.”\n<br><br>\nIn 1952, when we were small children and Green Hunter Homes (Atlanta Street Projects) were new, we lived in them. We attended Green Hunter Nursery. Mrs. Imogene Morrow Scott, Mrs. Margaret Greenlee, and others provided us with a good pre-school education. Our mom supplemented what we learned in nursery school by frequently telling us stories as she prepared our dinner and reading to us from “Little Golden Books”. The children of the family that momma worked for often passed their books on to us. We also received books as Christmas gifts.\n<br><br>\nBy 1958, we had lived in several areas:  Athens Highway (out the road), High Street, Lula, and finally Cloverdale Street in Newtown. As we grew older, we observed our parents modeling behavior which reflected their attitudes toward learning and education. Both of our parents were avid readers. Daddy always subscribed to the “Daily Times”. In addition, he often sent us on errands to the store to buy a copy of the “Atlanta Journal-Constitution”. Paperback books were abundant in our home. As a result, Bobbie Jean and I developed a love for books. During summer vacations, one of our favorite places to visit was the McCrary Branch of the Hall County Library. Miss McCrary and Mrs. Ella Rucker always encouraged us and we often received “Summer Reading Certificates”. One of Momma’s favorite past-times was to complete the newspaper’s crossword puzzle. She seldom left one incomplete.\n<br><br>\nWe were blessed with parents who sacrificed for us and planted a seed in us. Join us for the next edition, as Benjamin and I begin High School.",

The only difference is they pay up to a year early to give the board working capital. They also pay for other fundraising activities from their personal funds. Here is why they do it:\n<br><br>\nParticipating on the FSBH Board has been a real enjoyment. All of the events associated with the Reunion weekend are so much fun. I love reuniting that flame and my contribution to the reuniting of old and new friends and classmates. I enjoy that we are able to give back to some determined students,  a chance to further their education or training.\n<br><br>\n<b>Patience Lyles Jackson, Event Entertainment Coordinator</b>\n<br><br>\nMy reason for participating on the FSBH Board is that of giving back to the school and community that I grew up in, flourished and loved in.  I find it very rewarding to participate and work with a great group of individuals that have the ability to agree to disagree with the different tasks that are assigned to the FSBH Board.  It is not just about hosting a reunion every 2 years but about the building of a great unit for the fulfillment of 250 to 300 people for a 3-day weekend whereby people come together to reunite, have fun, enjoy one another and help to raise monies for scholarships for deserving students in the Gainesville/Hall County area.<br><br>\n<b>Theresa Anderson Puryear, Business Manager</b>\n <br><br>\nMy reason for participating on the FSBH Board is to keep the tradition going and to <b>preserve our motto Preserving Our Legacy While Preparing for The Future.\n<br><br>\nThomas Hailey, President </b>\n<br><br>\nMy reason for participating on the FSBH Board is that I enjoy being a part of something so spectacular and enjoyable. I look forward to every two years’ event to be able to reunite with my siblings, classmates and friends. The volunteering is hard work, but very rewarding at the end.\n<br><br>\n<b>Cynthia Randolph, Secretary </b>\n<br><br>\nWhy I joined the board?  My friends and classmates of my lifetime Theresa and Thomas. I joined hoping that I could assist our president and group in or with any measurable position within my ability. I was hoping to contribute by using my primary effort with any fund raising cause or causes for our scholarship program.  I also joined hoping that I could assist the President and the group with making sound decisions and making our board efforts in the community better, I am military retired.\n<br><br>\nI continue today volunteering my community services with the American Legion Post 328 and the Rock Creek Vietnam Veterans Group, using my military experiences, applying and extending my services with insuring that we are being recognized in the community.\n<br><br>\n<b>Harold Goss, CMSGT USAF (RET) 1968-1998, Car Show Coordinator</b>\n<br><br>\nThe reason I joined the board was to work with other board members, and to be an assistant to anyone that needs help in getting things together. I’m not very good at working on the computer but I’m willing to learn.\n<br><br>\n<b>Mary Moon Glen, Event Entertainment Coordinator</b>\n <br><br>\nI am the Chaplain for the Fair Street Butler High Alumni Board.  I “Thank” God for the opportunity to serve on this dynamic Board where there is friendliness and courtesy extended to each Board member.\n<br><br>\nI help to ensure the spiritual side of each member instilling in them the positive attitude that God will make a way out of no way and that if the Board keeps him first All things are possible.\n<br><br>\n<b>Rev. Eugene Whelchel, Chaplain</b><br><br>\nI serve on the Board of Directors as coordinator of History/Memorabilia because I love History. I enjoy researching our past, collecting and preserving our memorabilia, and rekindling memories of bygone days. In short, it is a labor of love.\n<br><br>\nLinda Rucker Hutchens, History & Memorabilia Coordinator\n<br><br>\nWe love to be together and we love to contribute to our community and town that has been ours for entire lives. Where else could we contribute to a cause we love, with friends we love & be together, sharing our love for each other?\n<br><br>\n<b>Bernice Wimpye, Event Registration Coordinator and James Wimpye, Parliamentarian</b>\n<br><br>\nI have served as the Prom and Sock Hop coordinator for FSBH Reunion. What I have found most rewarding is working with Pat, Cynthia, Dorothy, Shirley, and volunteer workers Phyllis Edmonds and Mary Ann Turner. We have built a beautiful bond. We all work very hard from the beginning to the end and we have so much fun working hard together. I admit that it can be very stressful running to wholesale markets gathering the candy and ordering all of the balloons for the sock hop. Much work goes into the decorations and every event has turned out perfectly. These wonderful ladies pull together to make it happen with their loving and giving spirits! I guess you can say this organization and event have always been in my blood! My parents were both students at Fair Street High School. Blondie Summerour, my mother, served on the very first alumni board. My father Stanford Summerour, now deceased served as President of the Metro Gainesville-Atlanta Connection organization.  I must admit that I have always felt such a great accomplishment in knowing that I’ve made my parents proud, to BE A MEMBER OF FSBH Alumni.\n<br><br>\n<b>Kimberly Summerour Paul, Event Entertainment Coordinator</b>\n<br><br>\nI never considered attending the FSBH Reunion until 2005. I felt it the reunion was designed for a few and focused on things not relevant to me. I finally came and had a wonderful time with people I had known well and some I had not been close to in high school. The latter showed me how things could be.  I decided to work with the BOD hard to promote and ensure inclusiveness at the Reunion. Because it does not matter if you finished high school on time, late or never. It also should not matter that you were wronged in some way in high school. It is time to move on. So we say to all our classmates and other friends:  If you feel a part of any specific class, you are. We welcome all who will come. I think the reunions of the past 10-12 years prove that they are a weekend of love and fun for all. This is due to the leadership and efforts of the BOD. I am honored to serve with them.\n<br><br>\n<b>John W. Harris, Membership, Communications & Golf Tournament</b>",

Shelton was born in Gainesville, GA to Nathaniel and Janie Shelton. Terrance initially became interested in music through singing in the Children’s Choir at St. John Baptist Church. In high school he was awarded Georgia All State Choir, as a male soprano, three consecutive times. Terrance was also a member of a local performing group, “Smooth Edition”, where he began writing lyrics for their songs.\n<br><br>\nAfter high school graduation Terrance attended Clark Atlanta University (CAU) majoring in Media Management. While matriculating at CAU he presided over the CAU Philharmonic Society and toured with them throughout the country. At CAU, he was introduced to Jermaine Dupri, (SoSo Def Records). Their relationship led to inclusions on many different recordings including rap duo Kris Kross, Silk Tymes Leather, and eventually culminating in a song which he co-wrote for LaFace Artist, TLC’s first album. He’s worked with many musicians, including Dionne Farris (Columbia Records), Van Hunt (Blue Note), Algebra (Motown, Omar (RCA), Trina Brossard (Motown) and more. In 2005, he released a song on the dance compilation, “Amanda Project: Relight”, which has successfully been remixed and added to other compilations in the U.S., Japan, and throughout Europe.\n<br><br>\nHis career as a celebrity wardrobe stylist has allowed him to work with many other musicians such as Arrested Development, Andre 3000, CeeLo Green, and legendary Grammy award winning, jazz vocalist, Cassandra Wilson. His works include everything from visual merchandising and advertising to the album cover, fashion shows, and wardrobe styling for film and television. His work in the fashion industry eventually garnered the attention of Black Enterprise magazine (March 2006) in which he was featured in a two page pictoral.\n<br><br>\nMost recently, Terrance has added the title of Assistant Prop master to his list of attributes. He stumbled into the film industry by chance and ended up on the set of history. As Assistant Prop master on “Selma”, Shelton was responsible for purchasing, acquiring and/or manufacturing any props needed for a production. But working on the set also meant he was a part of a feature film whose subject matter, while set in 1965, and couldn’t be timelier in 2014. He spoke with the Times, Newspaper Chelsey Abercrombie regarding his experience:\n<br><br>\nQuestion: (Chelsey) how did you get into the film industry?\n<br><br>\nAnswer: (Terrance) I was one of the many people (who) found themselves displaced and without a job after the downturn of the economy. So after being a buyer in retail for 16 years, I basically had to reinvent myself. I had been doing wardrobe on short films and small productions for PBS and so forth, because that was what I was familiar with. While I was doing those things, I met a prop master named Bill Butler who just kind of casually asked me if I would be interested in coming to assist him as some point if he got a gig.\n<br><br>\nQuestion: What are some of the projects you worked on before you got hired on “Selma”?\n<br><br>\nAnswer: I stayed in contact with (Bill Butler) and he eventually called me because he was given a BET show called “The Game.” That was their highest grossing show. It was actually on another network and it was canceled. But due to a groundswell of support, BET picked them up, so we were the very first to film in the new Screen Gems facility that took the place of the old Lakewood facility. I’ve done a few television shows, kind of cutting my teeth over at BET and did some made for TV movies. <b>“SELMA”</b> was my first feature film. In this capacity I’ve worked on shows such as BET’s<b>“The Game”, “Let’s Stay Together”,</b> and <b>“Read between the Lines”. </b>I completed the second season of <b>“The Rickey Smiley Show”.</b>\n<br><br>\nQuestion: What was it like working on a film whose subject matter carries such historical significance?\n<br><br>\nAnswer: It was obviously important that this message be told, and I think the thing I keep hearing said about {SELMA) is it’s so timely. How something that took place in 1965 still has relevance, particularly right now with all of the events in Ferguson and so forth. It’s a message that still needs to be told. It’s funny though – I think we’ve seen this depiction before. We’ve seen the atrocities of the Civil Rights era. But this story really focused more on the dialogue between Dr. King and LBJ, behind the scenes and essentially all of the things that led up to kind of forcing LBJ’s hand to enact legislation for (The Voter Right Act of 1965). It’s a very important story still to be told in this day and time.\n<br><br>\nQuestion: What are your plans for the future?\n<br><br>\nAnswer: I just finished working on a show called <b>Complication,</b> which will air on USA in the spring or summer. <b>Complications</b> is another show by a gentleman named Matt Nix. Nix is the creator of a show called, <b>Burn Notice </b>This is his interpretation of a medical drama. We finished filming that right before the holidays. Now it’s just onward and upward. I’m hoping to go back onto a show that I worked on last year called<b> The Rickey Smiley Show,</b> which airs on TV One. You just never know what’s around the corner.",

Butler High Class of 1963\n<br><br><br><br>\nFrom Lula, Georgia, to Salt Lake City, Utah\n<br><br><br><br>\nEveryone knows that over 58,000 names of those who died honorably in Vietnam during that\nlong conflict. Most do not know that, in many respects, these were the ones who suffered the least. Millions have long suffered related to physical and mental injuries resulting from their service. Even more, we have\nchronic and fatal diseases due to Agent Orange exposure by our government. All of them suffered greatly by not being welcomed back to the country they fought for. So Vietnam Vets welcome themselves home by saying to\nother vets, Welcome home, brother, and thanks for a job well done. Today, as a Vietnam veteran, I am proud and honored to welcome home a true American hero who has gone from Lula, Georgia, to Salt\nLake City, Utah, with stops in Vietnam and other places around the world, while serving our country? So in his own words, SFC Kenneth Thornton, US Army (Retired) and member of the 1963 class of E.E.\nButler High School tells his story. It is undoubtedly one of the most interesting in this series of Where are they\nnow?\n<br><br>\nThe Beginning</b>\n<br><br>\nLife started for me 65 years ago in the small town of Lula, Georgia, located about 13 miles north of Gainesville, Georgia.\nThe population of Lula was around 600 people, with around 12 black families. I started school when I was 5\nyears old, in a small segregated school, I believe, around 12 to 15 students. Mrs. Nancy Stephens was our\nteacher. When I entered the 7th grade, the Lula school system closed the school and started transporting all\nthe kids to Fair Street School in Gainesville, Georgia. Riding on the school bus was an exciting experience\nfor me, especially when we started going into the outskirts of Banks County to pick up more students. For me, it was a new adventure, a place I had never been before. I also remember that the old Hall County school bus had one heater located up in the front of the bus, near the driver. So, it got cold in the back of the bus (smile). But, to be kids sharing new adventures, life was always FUN, FUN, and FUN.\n<br><br>\n<b>After High School</b>\n<br><br>\nWhen I graduated from E. E. Butler High, I got a job working as a janitor at The Hall County Hospital.\nI think the pay per week was somewhere around $25.00. Looking back on that experience, I often\nwonder how I survived on that little money (smile). The Hospital was still segregated, but it was a pleasant workplace. Especially the fun we had doing our jobs and the fellowship we developed with each other.\n<br><br>\n<b>Military Service</b>\n<br><br>\nIn November 1964, I was drafted into the United States Army. After spending 24 years in the\nArmy, I retired as a Sergeant First Class (SFC). The highlights of my Army career: Basic training at Fort Gordon, Georgia, and Advance Individual Training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. I completed nine years stationed in Europe, four years\nin Korea, and numerous years stationed in Fort Hood, Texas, and Ft. Sill, Oklahoma. I also spent ten months of a one (1) year tour in Vietnam before I was medically evacuated to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, USA. Some insights into my Vietnam experiences: I was deployed to the Americal Division. Upon arriving in my unit, I was assigned the duty of a forward observer. As such, I would go out in the field with the Infantry to direct artillery, mortar, and attack Helicopters\ngunship fire support when needed. While in the field, I also volunteered to be a tunnel rat. Men who would crawl inside the Viet Cong tunnel networks to flush the enemy out and collect intelligent information. This was a critical but dangerous job, as we never knew who and what were in the tunnels I entered. I was wounded two times while in the field. I was awarded two Purple Heart medals for combat injuries. I was then assigned to be a section chief on\na 105-millimeter (mm) air mobile artillery section located on a fire support base. During a nighttime V.C. attack, I was hit with flying shrapnel from a 122 mm rocket. I received another purple Heart medal for that injury and was finally medically evacuated from Vietnam. I received a total of 3 Purple Heart Awards, The Bronze Star with valor (the\n4th Highest Combat Award in the U.S. Military) and 5 Good Conduct Medals during my Army career. Being drafted into the Army was not my idea, but it led to much more challenging and satisfying life than being a janitor at Hall County Hospital.\n<br><br>\n<b>Post Military/Federal Service</b>\n<br><br>\nBefore I retired from the Army, I was assigned to Dugway Proving Ground in Dugway, Utah. Dugway\nProving Ground is a government facility that conducts military testing and approves Military Munitions for the Armed Services. As a soldier, I was in charge of all the experimental rockets, missiles, artillery, and mortar testing. I interfaced with a host of civilians and military personnel. Using my military experience and expertise, I could\nretire from the Army and qualify as a Civilian Government employee. I am presently a GS-12 Physical Science Technician\nwith over 20 years of civilian service. I am looking forward to retiring again at age 67 for good (smile).\n<br><br>\n<b>Marriage</b>\n<br><br>\nOver the years, God has been good to me. Being away from home, I never in a million years expected to meet and marry a Georgian. But God knows EVERYTHING. I met and married the LOVE of my life, Bessie Ann Walker of Toccoa, GA. We have two grown children, three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. I am a faithful and active member of the Calvary Baptist church in Salt Lake City. I serve as an officer on the Board of Trustees, Sunday School Teacher (men’s class), and sing baritone in the Men’s Choir. I enjoy life to the fullest. I take pleasure in being around positive\npeople, laughing a lot, and reminiscing with good friends. We have already registered for the Butler Reunion and are\nlooking forward to meeting old and new friends, remembering, and making new memories. See you there!",

I remember the guy who taught me the words to “Daddy’s Home” in Chemistry class was Wilbur Mattox. I remember in the fourth grade that Lamar Young was going to run a funeral home with Hammond Dean and me. Most of all I remember the last time I saw Johnny Bill Robertson. He and I were on leave together before going to The Nam. I told him I would see him tomorrow because, like him, I was not going to Vietnam either. Instead, I decided to go and later found out that he did, too but did not make it. These were our classmates and friends who did not give their lives, but they were taken. Unlike us, they did not get older. It is for these and other brave men that we have Memorial Day. So, remember Jonny Bill, Lamar, Wilbur, Forrest Goudelock, Carl Thornton, and all the others who died so that we may enjoy freedom.\n<br><br>\nJohn Harris\n<br><br>\nButler Class of 1965\n<br><br>\nVietnam class of 1969\n<br><br>\n<b>One reply on “Memorial Day is not just for Bar B Q”</b>",

(FSBHSAA) website. Fair Street and E.E. Butler were high schools for African Americans in Gainesville/ Hall County. Georgia and surrounding areas during racial segregation. The principal, staff, students, and the community created a legacy of excellence, success, and pride. The sports teams, marching band, and choruses performed consistently in a manner that supported and heightened the pride of the small, tightly-knit African American (then Colored) community.  The final class graduated in 1969, as students attended the previously all-White schools in the students’ localities.\nOur organization strives to <b>Preserve the heritage and Prepare </b>that proud community’s future. Former students of the schools formed a Reunion Committee to sponsor a biennial school reunion initially. The Reunion Committee of 1991 has morphed into a non-profit 501(c)3 corporation that raises funds to support the community through scholarships and projects to continue the heritage and help the community’s people thrive.\n<br><br>\nWe are constantly looking for ways to accomplish our mission and for people to help us.  We welcome you to join us if you are interested in volunteering your time, knowledge, or financial sponsorship.\n<br><br>\nJohn W. Harris, President\n<br><br>\nClass of 1965",

However, we do much more than put on the party biennially. We began planning and negotiating for Reunion 2019 a few weeks after closing Reunion 2017. That’s why we can contain our cost and ticket prices to you.\n<br><br>\nThe Board recently completed an extensive planning process. We have four teams Reunion &amp; Events, New Projects, scholarships, and Religious &amp; Spiritual. These are some of the ideas and projects resulting from the planning process:\n<br><br>\nIncrease revenue from the golf tournament and execute 3 other fundraising projects to subsidize the costs of Reunion 2019.<br><br>\nTo define the needs of young males in our community and plan to assist them.<br><br>\nWe will attempt to get the old E.E. Butler gymnasium renovated or replaced.<br><br>\nOur Spiritual Team plans to support bereaved families through prayer and actions via a small annual budget.<br><br>\nNot only will the Reunion &amp; Event Team plan &amp; execute the best reunion ever, but they are also planning a New Year’s Eve party in Gainesville.<br><br>\nThe Scholarship Team plans to either increase the number and the size of the awards to support our young people.<br><br>\nWe have other plans and ideas to improve our home community and enrich the lives of our members and friends. So, where do you fit? I am attaching a financial report from Mr. Shelton. We are in a good position, thanks to your generosity. You provided funding in 2017 that permits us to have a working balance as we prepare for 2019. Please commit to doing the same or better moving forward. You can pledge as a Tiger Level – at $1,000+, Maroon Level at $500+, or White Level at $25. I will post the benefits of each level with the Financial Report. But, Tiger Level includes Couples or Single Fees for the reunion. At $500 but less than $1,000, Reunion 2019 fees will be discounted significantly but not yet determined. Above all, at each level, you are helping your organization Preserve our Legacy and Protect our Future.\n<br><br>\nBernice Harbin Wimpye reminds us to act now and avoid the stress of last-minute decisions and financial burden but:\n<br><br>\nChoose your level of commitment.<br><br>\nContact Mr. Nathaniel Shelton at gnat2190@charter.net to set up a monthly or quarterly payment plan<br><br>\nReserve your room at the Airport Marriott. You guarantee payment with a credit card, but you don’t have to pay until you check out next year.<br><br>\nEnsure you pay the total commitment before the deadline.<br><br>\nAsk your children and grandchildren to join you on Saturday’s Family Day (aka cookout)<br><br>\nStart anticipating the fun of seeing your friends, classmates and new friends.<br><br>\nShow up and party!!<br><br>\nThanks, my friends. We all appreciate your support, and need to see you at Reunion 2019!\t\t\n\t\t\t<table width=\"523\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"64\"></td>\n<td width=\"64\"></td>\n<td colspan=\"6\" width=\"395\">FAIR STREET-BUTLER HIGH SCHOOL ALUMNI ASSOCIATION</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">FINANCIAL REPORT</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td colspan=\"3\">January 1 to August 31, 2018</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Beginning Balance</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>$10,395.79</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Income</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Class of 1965</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>105.00</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Class of 1965 by Bernice Wimpye</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>255.00</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Registration fees –Terry Edward Gaither</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>350.00</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Marriott Reimbursement</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>75.54</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">John Harris Contribution (1965 class)</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>786.51</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Juneteenth receipts</td>\n<td>$587.50</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Juneteenth supplies</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>-500</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Juneteenth change</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>-160</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Juneteenth Booth Registration</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>-25</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Juneteenth cash returned</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>144</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Juneteenth Net Income</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>46.50</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Expenses</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Self Storage fee</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>64.00</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Marriott Deposit for Reunion 2019</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>750.00</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">PO Box rental</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>82.00</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Office Pro ( Print Scholarship Applications</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>4.62</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Grady Young Foundation Donation</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>300.00</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Self Storage fee</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>64.00</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Self Storage fee</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>64.00</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Self Storage fee</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>64.00</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Self Storage fee</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>67.00</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Self Storage fee</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>67.00</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Self Storage fee</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>67.00</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Harris floral</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>88.28</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Self Storage fee</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>67.00</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Scholarship Payments</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>2,000.00</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Constant Contact Payment – June</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>96.00</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\">Frame for Michael Hancock Honorary Diploma</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>54.38</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">WordPress for new Website</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>61.00</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Constant Contact – September</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>146.13</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Website Design &amp;

I do hope that during the Holiday season, you remembered someone else to show your gratitude.  We have so much to be “Thankful” for.  I like to buy a gift to give to someone that just shows up or that I happen to meet in my comings and goings.\n<br><br>\nThe Alumni Board is excited about Reunion 2017, and we are looking forward to an even bigger turnout than the year’s pasts. The location has changed, but that’s a chance to have a mini vacation in another setting. Why not give it some thought and register, and let’s have a wonderful celebration. If you remember, during Reunion 2015, there was an appeal regarding Booster Donors well, we have our first Booster Donor, and we say “Thank You” for being mindful and getting the ball rolling. So, with that being said — how many other Alumni can we add to the list?\n<br><br>\nThe Alumni Board is mindful of those we have lost, and our condolences go out to them and their families.\n<br><br>\nWe need and want your support for Reunion 2017. We wish each of you a Merry Christmas and a Joyous & Happy New Year.\n<br><br>\nThomas Hailey – President FSBH Assn. Inc.,\n<br><br>\nClass of 1967",

The dates of August 28-30, 2015, and they are coming upon us very quickly. We are working diligently to get things in order for you to have the best time ever during the reunion. We are planning for and expecting one of the largest turnouts since the early reunion days. This year marks our 24th year, and the 12th biannual reunion and meeting. This has been a remarkable period of time for us as individual students, graduates, teachers and alumni. Many of our friends have departed this world. Without being maudlin, this is why we should make a diligent effort to attend every reunion and/or meeting that is held in the honor of those of us who attended Fair Street and Butler High Schools. As the old Hymnal song says, “It may be the last time, I don’t know.”  We should remind ourselves of this inevitable situation during every opportunity we have to attend these reunion events. Our theme and our tagline is “Preserving our legacy and Preparing for our future.  Both of these require getting our children, and grandchildren to replace us. Think of ways to get your family to understand what that legacy is and how they help us preserve it.  Some participation in this reunion is a good start.\n<br><br> \nDuring the past few of months, it has been brought to the attention of the FSBHSAA Board that some alumni members had made room reservations at the Legacy Lodge on Lake Lanier, and the deposit for the first night’s stay was immediately charged to the credit/debit card. Well, now you can rest at ease. Due to the diligent efforts of our very energetic and persuasive Business Manager, that situation has been resolved.  Even though it is their policy to collect for the first night in advance, it has been WAIVED for us. Your room deposits will not be charged to you card until you arrive. However, rooms are always a major issue for us. So make your room reservations NOW.\n<br><br>\nWe (The Board) work diligently to publish the newsletter as a means to provide you with important information and keep you up to date with the business matters of interest and other organizational matters. Please take the time to read every article in each publication to insure you have the current and correct information on the issues presented. More importantly, take action called for in the articles helping your organization to be successful.\n<br><br>\nWe can’t wait to see you at the reunion\n<br><br>\nBobby R. Stephens\n<br><br>\nPresident – Class of 1960",

Your FSBH Alumni Board has been\nworking hard in the off year to make Reunion 2011 the best reunions ever. You\nmay have read that this year we gave not one but TWO scholarships. We had\nseveral fundraiser events where we worked hard, had a great time and even\nraised some monies. We now have a Public Relations Consultant (PR) on board, by\nthe name of Rojene Bailey. He will help with promotions and other ways to reach\nthe “Maroon & White Tiger Nation” as John Harris has aptly called\nthe Alumni family. We also have our very own Certified Public Auditor (CPA),\nTerry Gaither has done a wonderful job.\n<br><br>\nWe have a lot of planning and work to do before the Reunion\n2011, which will involve all age groups. So come on let’s make this a\n“FAMILY AFFAIR. ” We are also adding a worship/fellowship experience\nSunday morning before the closing program. Water ski rides, horseback\nriding, and the beach is also available, along with walking trails, and of course. the golf\ntournament, a little something something\nfor the Alumni and your families. So, as you celebrate the season, please do not\nforget the meaning of the season. Why not take the time to call someone you\nhaven’t talked to in a while? Why not send someone a card? Why not text, or\nemail a friend? When all else fails, why not just go visit someone? We are\nblessed in many ways. We need to continue the blessing by passing it on\n<br><br>\nWe look forward to seeing you at Reunion 2011 at Lake Lanier\nIslands Resort.\n<br><br>\nAgain, Have a Safe and Blessed Holiday Season.\n<br><br>\nSincerely,\n<br><br>\nThomas Hailey\n<br><br>\nPresident\nFair Street-Butler High Schools Alumni Association, Inc.",

For years they have used lies, distortions, and race-baiting to divide this country. Recently, it’s gotten downright dangerous. Earlier this summer, a heavily armed man got into a gun fight with police after he was pulled over on his way to kill people at the Tides Foundation[1] — an obscure non-profit that Glenn Beck regularly demonizes on his Fox News TV show.[2]\n<br><br>\nFox News is bad news for America — and it spreads, and is legitimized, partly through TVs in public places.\n<br><br>\nThat’s why I’ve joined the TurnOffFox campaign — the first part of a larger campaign to diminish the influence of Fox. It’s about educating people about Fox and getting it turned off in stores, restaurants, and other public places.\n<br><br>\nWill you join me? It takes just a moment to declare your own household “Fox free”, and at the same time appeal to public establishments in your community to stop playing Fox. And you’ll get a FREE Turn Off Fox sticker when you do. Click here:\n<br><br>\nhttp://colorofchange.org/turnofffox/?id=1677-1245045\n<br><br>\nNo other news organization that’s considered legitimate consistently wages smear campaigns based on lies and race-baiting. But for years Fox News has done exactly that, and the pattern has only gotten worse since Barack Obama entered national politics.\n<br><br>\nHere are just a few examples:\n<br><br>\n— A frequent Fox guest, Jesse Lee Peterson, said that the majority of Black people have poor moral character, and cited “what they did to the dome” after Hurricane Katrina as evidence.[3] Peterson has also used his platform on Fox to claim that 90% of Black people are racists — against Whites.[4]\n— In a case of naked race-baiting, Fox host Glenn Beck called President Obama a “racist” who had a “deep-seated hatred for White people or the White culture.”[5] Earlier that week, Beck claimed that the President’s health insurance reform proposals were a form of “reparations” designed to “settle old racial scores.”[6]\n<br><br>\n— Fox host John Stossel argued that the public accommodations section of the Civil Rights Act — which prevents businesses from discriminating based on race, sex, and other factors — should be repealed.[7]\n<br><br>\n— Fox News hosts Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity were the first to air deceptively edited and incomplete video of Shirley Sherrod’s remarks to the NAACP.[8] The video made it seem like Sherrod was confessing to using her position at the USDA to discriminate against White farmers, when she was really talking about the importance of overcoming prejudice. Sherrod lost her job over this misrepresentation, which Fox enthusiastically repeated without seeking the facts. Fox has since tried to pretend it had nothing to do with this smear — but Fox is the number one reason these kinds of distortions and smears have any part in our national dialogue.\n<br><br>\nThe examples above aren’t even a tenth of Fox’s vicious lies and smears, and over the years they’ve just gotten more brazen.\nThe goal of Turn Off Fox is to reduce the number of public TVs showing Fox News, while spreading the word about Fox’s poison (and how it works) to those who don’t know.\n<br><br>\nSigning up for the campaign is just the first step. We make it easy for you to tell us about businesses playing Fox. If you’re willing to talk with them, we’ll provide you with straightforward materials that explain why they shouldn’t be a party to what Fox is doing. And if there are businesses you know that want to tell the world they would never play Fox, you can help them declare themselves a “Fox-free zone.”\n<br><br>\nAs businesses Turn off Fox and stand up as Fox Free, and as we encourage our friends and family to do the same, we’ll help make clear, to people across the country, what Fox is about. And we’ll reduce their ability to do harm.\n<br><br>\nPlease join me in signing up for the TurnOffFox campaign:\n<br><br>\nhttp://colorofchange.org/turnofffox/?id=1677-1245045\n<br><br>\nThanks.\n<br><br>\nReferences\n<br><br>\n1. http://bit.ly/a5F7kW<br>\n2. http://mediamatters.org/research/201007290032<br>\n3. http://mediamatters.org/research/200510030005<br>\n4. http://bit.ly/c060C0<br>\n5. http://mediamatters.org/research/200907300019<br>\n6. http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/200907230040<br>\n7. http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/201005200033<br>\n8. http://mediamatters.org/blog/201007200060",

How does something like that happen? So, in the beginning, I was simply trying to understand his world, but the more time I spent with him, the more I discovered how little we really understood about his world. And thus, began to uncover not just more about him and how he came to do it, his resourcefulness, his resilience, his mom, the mentorship, the opportunities he was given.”\nOn Saturday, because of Byas’s lifetime service to education, he was awarded the King Medal from Columbia University.\n<br><br>\n“I feel honored,” he said. “Columbia University is where I earned a master’s degree in New York before starting my teaching career. They choose five graduates they deem outstanding, and then they award them for their contribution to education.”\n<br><br>\nNahas Angula, Prime Minister of Namibia, will also be honored at the ceremony and deliver the keynote address. Byas could not attend the function in New York but delivered a recorded speech to the crowd.\n<br><br>\nBut even though Byas has received many high honors over the years working in the education field, his biggest achievement always has been watching students excel. From small Douglas County to Gainesville and beyond, Byas always wanted bigger and better.\n<br><br>\n“I made a reputation in Douglasville of improving the schools so much that my work spread, and so they recruited me to come up,” he said. “I went up there (to Gainesville), and they offered me a job, and it paid significantly more money, but Douglasville is where it all started.”\n<br><br>\nByas had only been at the school for two months when he set out to increase the funding at the school. He started a nine-month survey to bring awareness to Fair Street’s lack of needs and improve the curriculum.\n<br><br>\n“When I started the survey, I convinced the parents and everybody to cooperate,” he said. “I gained confidence in a hurry in the community; that’s why all of these honors are coming now.”\n<br><br>\nByas kept working tirelessly to improve the education he provided for black children, but within 10 years, the honeymoon was over.\n<br><br>\n“I was disappointed with Gainesville and the board of education because at that time, Gainesville High School did not have a person who had experience as a principal, and I had 10 years,” he said. “They wouldn’t integrate the schools, so I protested and quit, and the public was upset because I quit.”\n<br><br>\nToday, Byas lives in Macon with his wife, Annamozel, with whom he has been married for 57 years and has four children.\n<br><br>\nByas said the Gainesville community was ahead of the curve as far as race relations go in the 1960s. He said the superintendent and the school board had problems with integration.\n<br><br>\n“I called the superintendent a segregationist, and we disagreed, but he wanted to give me a job that was not in keeping with my skills and experience. They named a person who was on the faculty of the white high school who had never been a principal, and I quit,” Byas said.\n<br><br>\nHis students were affected most by the move, but it was expected, said former Fair Street and E.E. Butler High student Emory Turner.\n<br><br>\n“A lot of people were upset, but it became the acceptance of the times,” Turner said. “We really would have slowed down if they had given him the principalship that he deserved, which would have been at Gainesville High School, and that was out of the question.”\n<br><br>\nTurner said he was happy to have Byas as a principal because he cared about his students.\n<br><br>\n“He fought hard to ensure we got all the things we needed,” Turner said. “He was a very stern man. One of the things I remember was that he made sure that we did when we got to the new Butler High School, as we spent a lot of time cleaning the school when we would dirty it up. Part of our punishment would be cleaning the school … the baseboards, the windows, the walls.”\n<br><br>\nOther notable Gainesville residents that were former students of Byas are former Hall County Commissioner Deborah Mack and Gainesville council member Myrtle Figueras.\n<br><br>\nAfter Byas left Gainesville, he became employed with the All-Black State Teachers Organization as the assistant executive secretary.\n<br><br>\n“Through the professional development activities in which he engages, it also shows us this world of very intentioned, professional development, this network of black educators,” Walker said. “So, I think in so doing, he brings to life this whole world and helps us understand how we got the kind of education that we got throughout the South.\n<br><br>\n“He becomes a prototype for black professors that are unnamed, across the South, but who managed to create schools that communities remember.”\n<br><br>\nPrint ArticlePrint Article | E-mail ArticleE-mail Article | Newsletter Sign upSign up for our E-mail Newsletter |\nBookmark and Share\nPrevious Story | Next Story\n<br><br>\nYou must be logged in to post comments.LOG INhttp://www.gainesvilletimes.com/ encourages readers to interact with one another.

But Stafford is no typical 13-year-old he’s a college student. The triple-major child prodigy is becoming a sensation at Morehouse College.\n<br><br>\nI’ve never taught a student as young as Stephen, and it’s been amazing,” said computer science professor Sonya Dennis. He’s motivating other students to do better and makes them want to step up their game.\n<br><br>\nWhen I saw how much knowledge Stephen had at such a young age, I wondered what I had been doing with my life, laughed third-year student Eric Crawford. A psychology major and computer science minor, Crawford wanted to step up his game so much that he got Stephen to tutor him. Even though I’m older, Stephen is like a mentor and my elder in computer science, said Crawford.\n<br><br>\nEven at age 11, when Stafford started at Morehouse, he got the highest score in his pre-calculus class. He breezes through whatever I throw at him. If it’s an hour lab, he can do it in 20 or 30 minutes, said Dennis.\nStafford said he isn’t nervous about studying with students much older than himself. I just do what I always did. He said I show up, I do the work, and I go home.\n<br><br>\nStafford s mother, Michelle Brown-Stafford, home-schooled her children (Stephen has an older sister also in college) and believes that parental involvement is essential for students to excel. But when she realized her son was starting to teach her instead of being taught, she knew he needed to be in a college environment.\nIt was surreal because, on the one hand, he was talking about technical things I didn’t even understand, and on the other hand, he was asking me to come to watch Sponge Bob with him. So it was bittersweet to let him go.\n<br><br>\nBrown-Stafford wondered if there were other parents who shared her experiences with a gifted child, so she helped found a support group: www.gifted-spirit.com http://www.gifted-spirit.com/ .\n<br><br>\nAnd the Morehouse family has become a support group for Stafford, personifying the African proverb about it taking a village to raise a child. Stafford is too young to stay on campus, so his mother picks him up and drops him off daily. According to his mother and Stafford, the students protect him and make a point not to curse or discuss certain mature issues around him. Even the staff of Jazzman’s Cafe, where Stafford tutors Crawford, helps nurture Stephen into becoming a Morehouse Renaissance Manwell-spoken, well-dressed, well-read, well-traveled, and well-balanced. The cafes General Manager, Darren Page, added an unofficial principle: well-fed. A Morehouse Man cannot study on an empty stomach, said, Page. So whenever Stafford comes to Jazzman’s, Page gives up his own employee meal for the 13-year-old.It seems that everyone wants to be a part of helping Stafford graduate in 2012, and go on to Morehouse School of Medicine. And because of a Georgia law that requires a student to be 16 to graduate high school, hell be getting his high school diploma the same year he receives his college degrees in math, computer science and pre-med.Kids will live up to your expectations. But I ultimately want Stephen to be happy, said Stephen Stafford Sr. Brown-Stafford added, I want him to be well-rounded and still connect with kids his own age, so we put him in DeKalb County 4-H Club and other programs. She added that she’s thankful to the Morehouse family for embracing her son. I want to see what Stephen becomes ten years from now, said Crawford. Page added I want to be at his graduation. And then I want to walk by and touch the [campus] statue of Dr. Martin Luther King and recognize I had a role in [Stephen] walking in Martin Luther King’s footsteps. And how fitting, since Dr. King entered Morehouse at age 15. So to put a spin on Dr. Kings I Have a Dream speech, Stephen is being judged by the content of his character, not by his age.",

President Obama also did not typically win the white male votes even in the states that he won. The Obama victory came from mainly the larger support by white women, the high black voter turnout, and the Latino American voters in the western states.\n<br><br>\nSo, as many people think that whites in the United States are very much different than they were in the past. The results might give one a different image of how far the nation still has to go.\n<br><br>\nMuch of this is political party-based support. Although it can be truly argued that many whites don’t support the Democratic party due to its diversity since the late 1960s and its more aggressive support of people of color in the United States. Thus, whites, typically in a majority support the Republican candidate for president with the same type of voter turnout numbers.\n<br><br>\nFor the past 40 years, whites have made up 74 percent to somewhere north of 90 percent of all voters.\n<br><br>\nLyndon B. Johnson was the last Democrat to win a majority of the white vote. He signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act into law.\n<br><br>\nJimmy Carter got elected president by narrowing to 4 percentage points the gap between whites voting Republican and whites voting Democratic.\n<br><br>\nBill Clinton got elected president by narrowing to 2 percentage points the gap between whites voting Republican and whites voting Democratic.\n<br><br>\nAl Gore lost the white vote by 12 percentage points.\n<br><br>\nJohn Kerry lost the white vote by 17 percentage points.\n<br><br>\nBarack Obama lost the white vote by 8 percentage points nationally. He received 43 percent of the total white vote.</b>\n<br><br>\nWhite men 41 percent\n<br><br>\nWhite women 46 percent\n<br><br>\nBarack Obama did win 54 percent of all white voters age 18 to 29. Showing that whites over age 30 are the ones who are reluctant to support the political party that typically supports all races, ethnicities and genders. These older whites are either those who lived through Jim Crow white privilege or are the children of those Baby Boomers who did, meaning they may harbor some of the same racial thoughts as their parents and grand parents.\n<br><br>\n2008 US Presidential General Election Results\n<br><br>\nRankStatePopulation (2008 est.)\n<br><br>\nBlue States Obama Victory\n<br><br>\nRed States McCain Victory\n<br><br>\nPurple text is where Obama won the white vote.\n<br><br>\nThe first percent number shows the percentage of whites who did not vote for Obama.

to ponder:\n<br>\nMany people are not aware that even though President Obama won the election, he did not win the majority of the white vote in most states that he won. President Obama also did not typically win the white male votes even in the states that he won. The Obama victory came from mainly the larger support by white women, the high black voter turnout and the Latino American voters in the western states.\n<br>\nSo, as many people think that whites in the United States are very much different than they were in the past. The results might give one a different image of how far the nation still has to go.\n<br>\nMuch of this is political party based support. Although it can be truly argued that many whites don’t support the Democratic party due to its diversity, since the late 1960s, and its more aggressive support of people of color in the United States. Thus, whites typically in a majority support the Republican candidate for president with the same type of voter turn out numbers.\n<br>\nFor the past 40 years, whites have made up 74 percent to somewhere north of 90 percent of all voters.\n<br>\nLyndon B. Johnson was the last Democrat to win a majority of the white vote. He signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act into law.\n<br>\nJimmy Carter got elected president by narrowing to 4 percentage points the gap between whites voting Republican and whites voting Democratic.\n<br>\nBill Clinton got elected president by narrowing to 2 percentage points the gap between whites voting Republican and whites voting Democratic.\n<br>\nAl Gore lost the white vote by 12 percentage points.\n<br>\nJohn Kerry lost the white vote by 17 percentage points.\n<br>\nBarack Obama lost the white vote by 8 percentage points nationally. He received 43 percent of the total white vote.\n<br>\nWhite men 41 percent\n<br>\nWhite women 46 percent\n<br>\nBarack Obama did win 54 percent of all white voters age 18 to 29. Showing that whites over age 30 are the ones who are reluctant to support the political party that typically supports all races, ethnicities and genders. These older whites are either those who lived through Jim Crow white privilege or are the children of those Baby Boomers who did, meaning they may harbor some of the same racial thoughts as their parents and grand parents.\n<br>\n2008 US Presidential General Election Results\n<br>\nRankStatePopulation (2008 est.)\n<br>\nBlue States Obama Victory\n<br>\nRed States McCain Victory\n<br>\nPurple text is where Obama won the white vote.\n<br>\nThe first percent number shows the percent of whites who did not vote for Obama. In many cases even when Obama won a state he didn’t win the majority of white voters.\n<br>\n1California36,756,666\n<br>\nWhite Vote: 46% (Obama received 52%)\n<br>\nWhite Male Vote: 48% (Obama

Explains the crisis in our world today and the connection that spirituality plays in it all. Were in more than an economic crisis. Were in a moral, spiritual, mental, emotional and physical crisis. The economic crisis is just here to get our attention. The life process, which includes the evolution of the soul, the non-death, past lives, reincarnation and the importance of understanding the whys of it all, is explained in connection to our world crisis. This book explains the root cause of hatred and racism, the Armageddon of our time and the gift that it offers. It also explains why you cant kill life and why suicide is not the answer as well as the many disguises of karma. This book reveals the deeper hidden meaning and messages for us in the allegories in Genesis and the virgin birth and explains the exact moment when Jesus became the Christ. These thought provoking revelations will stir up your mind and have you hungry for more information. In addition to being a guide to enlightenment and being a self- help tool, this book also provides many spiritual insights on certain scriptures of the Bible. Now more than ever people are waking up out of this deep sleep state of mind and becoming conscious. This book is a guide that readers will come back to several times to study and have several “Aha” and Wow moments. There are questions presented in this book that only you can answer. Eventually, we all will become the spiritual divine beings that we originally came here to be. Only then will we begin to live a life filled with love, peace, health, beauty and prosperity. Gods will is done on earth. Love Light, and PowerPat Katakio Synopsis from book, “Revelations New Beginnings”, by Pat Katakio EEP. These Eye Openers are sayings to wake you up to understanding life’s principles and Spiritual Truths. So when you read the scriptures with an open mind and apply these understandings in your everyday living, that will produce the perfect out come in your life.<br />While writing Revelations: New Beginnings, it was revealed to me why God introduced me to the great world of Meta-physics and why He gave me the Spiritual gifts. I have to explain certain Spiritual Truths to the world, which are revealed in this book. This revelation is really an Eye Opener, and when the shock and disbelief are over, you will clearly see it for the truth that it is. You will understand that you were deliberately deceived so you would not access the power within as Jesus told us we had, to live a life of health and prosperity. Without knowing and using the power we possess, we remain ignorant and get nowhere in life, and the soul can’t grow and evolve.<br />This is why Jesus was crucified. He was teaching the people about the invisible power that we all possess inside, called God, and how to access this power through prayer. The chief priests, scribes, and elders did not want the people to know this truth; they feared that they would not be able to control the people.<br />With this new insight of truth explained, we will have a change in consciousness, and this will be the New Beginning of life for us that are ready to take responsibility for all our actions. Thanks for your support</p>",

Daddy kept his college textbooks which provided us with additional reference material. We were financially poor but there was never a shortage of books or reading material in our home.</p><p>During our high school years, Daddy who was especially good at math supplemented his income by preparing other people’s income taxes during tax season. He had taught me to do fractions in elementary school and now as high school students, he often quizzed us. His favorite question was “What is the hypotenuse of a triangle?” Of course, after a while we were able to answer that question by rote. Later, we were even able to recite the formula for determining the length.</p><p>In 1963 our family was completed with the birth of Jonathan, our youngest brother. By this time Benjamin and I had already set our goals for future careers. He had decided that he wanted to be a doctor and I had decided to be his nurse. Walt and Bobbie were students at Fair Street Elementary School.</p><p>Our teachers at Fair Street and E.E. Butler High School were instrumental in motivating us to achieve to our full potential. I recall being in a couple of math classes taught by Mrs. Ivey Hughey with my brother, Benjamin. Although we sat in the same classes, we did not study or do homework together. We never shared our homework. We were always too proud and too competitive to ever do that. Benjamin was always a better math student than I and consequently, made better grades.</p><p>Our parents did not have a lot of money but if we needed school supplies they were willing to sacrifice to see that we got them. Once, my sister Bobbie had a science project to do. She chose to do a project that involved the reproduction of hamsters. This project required not only the cost of the hamsters but their cage and other supplies as well. The project was somewhat expensive. Nevertheless, our mother somehow managed to purchase the hamsters, the cage, and all of the other necessary supplies out of her meager household budget.</p><p>Our parents’ rules of mandatory school attendance and completing homework assignments were enforced throughout high school. Unless we were really sick, we attended school daily as was evidenced by the large number of perfect attendance certificates we received throughout those years. Momma and Daddy did a good job of indoctrinating us with the idea that education was the path to upward mobility.</p><p>Both parents instilled a solid work ethic in us. While we were in high school, Daddy worked at J.D. Jewell’s Poultry and Momma worked in the laboratory at Hall County Hospital. Later, after Benjamin and I entered college, Momma too worked at J. D. Jewell. Upon reaching the age of fourteen, we obtained jobs. Bobbie and I began working as domestics, ironing and cleaning in private homes. Benjamin’s first jobs were doing yard work on Green Street and washing dishes in the dining room at Hall County Hospital (now Northeast Georgia Medical Center). Walter also did yard work on Green Street. When we reached the age of sixteen, we began working on public jobs during summer vacations. I worked at the hosiery mill as a dye boarder. My sister Bobbie worked with my mother in the cut-up department of J. D. Jewell’s. Daddy got jobs for all of my brothers at J.D. Jewell’s from the time that they turned sixteen until they finished school. They didn’t have to fill out an application. Every summer their jobs awaited them. They worked on the live dock hanging live chickens. This was the filthiest job in the plant. Our daddy would tell them; “If you don’t go to school, this is what you will be doing for the rest of your life.” My brothers very eagerly returned to school each year. We bought school clothes and supplies with our earnings. Later, we used our money to help pay college tuition and other expenses.</p><p>I graduated from E. E. Butler High School with honor on my birthday, June 6, 1966. My parents suggested that I attend Gainesville Jr. College (now the University of North Georgia, Gainesville campus) which was scheduled to open in the fall of 1966. I honored their wishes and enrolled in the college in the fall of 1966. I became the first African-American student to graduate from Gainesville Jr. College in June, 1968. During the two years I spent at Gainesville Jr. College, I changed my major to Education. I was accepted and enrolled in classes at the University of Georgia in the fall of 1968. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Education from UGA in June, 1970. I was immediately hired by the Gainesville City School System where I taught for 30+ years. While teaching at Fair Street School, I earned a Master’s degree in Education from North Georgia College (now the University of North Georgia, Dahlonega campus). I am currently retired.</p><p>My brother Benjamin graduated from E.E. Butler High School in June, 1967 as class valedictorian. He enrolled in Gainesville Jr. College in the fall of 1967 and graduated in June, 1969. He transferred to the University of Georgia and graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in June, 1971. He entered the Medical College of Georgia in the fall of 1971. In June, 1975 he fulfilled his childhood dream by receiving his degree as a doctor of medicine. After a year of internship and two years of residency at Talmadge Memorial Hospital, Benjamin joined the Medical College faculty for two years. In July of 1980, he began a private practice of 36 years duration. He is presently semi-retired.</p><p>My sister, Bobbie graduated from Gainesville High School in June, 1970. She too attended Gainesville Jr. College. She also studied accounting at Lanier Tech. Bobbie worked for Commercial Credit for two and a half years. She then worked for Liberty Mutual Insurance for 31 years. Bobbie enrolled in a number of insurance courses during her tenure at Liberty Mutual. She obtained an Associate in Principals of insurance (AIS) degree and became a Property Rater Specialist. In 2013, she officially retired from Liberty Mutual and graduated Summa Cum Laude from Walden University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology and Health Sciences. She currently volunteers as a Medicare Counselor with Georgia Cares at Legacy Link in Oakwood, Georgia.</p><p>Walter (Walt) graduated from Gainesville High School in 1973. Walt enrolled in courses at Gainesville College and transferred to Savannah State College. He graduated from Savannah State with a Bachelor’s degree in 1978. Walt was accepted and entered the University of Georgia, School of Law in 1979. He graduated from law school and passed the Georgia State Bar Exam in 1982. Shortly thereafter he began practicing with Thurmond, Thurmond and Miller of Athens, Georgia. In 1992, he partnered with Curtis Miller to bring his practice to Gainesville. Walt established his own law practice of Rucker and Associates in 1994. He continues to practice law in Gainesville, Georgia.</p><p>Jonathan, our youngest brother was an honor graduate of the Class of 1982 of Gainesville High School. He entered the Georgia School of Technology (GA Tech) in the fall of 1982 and graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering. Jonathan began his career with Atlanta Gas Light Company. Other companies he has been employed by include CH2M Hill, Khafra Engineering, Jordan, Jones, and Goulding and AECOM. In 2008, Jonathan established his own engineering consulting company, Engineered Systems and Services. He is registered as a professional certified engineer in the states of Georgia, Alabama, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Ohio. Jonathan’s business is thriving and he has been able to hire several employees in recent years.</p><p>The third and fourth generations appear to be following in the footsteps of the second and continuing the legacy of the first generation. Thus far all of our children have completed high school as scheduled. They have chosen to engage in a wide range of careers including medical assistant, computer technology, business informatics, banking and finance, and teaching. In addition, Erika Rucker is pursuing a medical degree at the Medical College of Georgia; Jasmine Rucker graduated from Hampton Institute and is enrolled in law school in North Carolina and Nicholous Benjamin Tyler Rucker graduated from Cabarrus County High School in North Carolina as the valedictorian of his 2016 Class of 300+ students. He and his first cousin Alyssa Archey who also graduated high school with honors are presently attending college.</p><p>I believe that “Mr. Bennie” who died in 1996 and “Miss Johnnie” who died in 1989 would be delighted with and proud of the success of the family that they worked so diligently to rear, nurture and support.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<style>/*! elementor - v3.20.0 - 20-03-2024 */\n.elementor-widget-image{text-align:center}.elementor-widget-image a{display:inline-block}.elementor-widget-image a img[src$=\".svg\"]{width:48px}.elementor-widget-image img{vertical-align:middle;display:inline-block}</style>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"400\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://fsbhtiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bods-17-3.png\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://fsbhtiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bods-17-3.png 400w, https://fsbhtiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bods-17-3-300x300.png 300w, https://fsbhtiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bods-17-3-150x150.png 150w, https://fsbhtiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bods-17-3-100x100.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" />",

The unit is a chance for neighborhood residents to be involved in the future planning of their areas of the city.</p><p>When it was first formed in 2007, the Fair Street planning unit spent its first year organizing and meeting with members of various city departments and determining goals and objectives for the future of the 330-acre area situated on the city’s south side.</p><p>Most of the group’s goals are simple: Members want to protect the residential nature of the area they call home, get rid of the blight, and make others appreciate the area.</p><p>An attempt to rezone as Neighborhood Conservation an area of the neighborhood stretching from Race Street to Fair Street is the planning unit’s first step toward those goals.</p><p>Because of the smaller lot sizes in the neighborhood, the area is actually zoned to allow multifamily uses, such as apartments. That multifamily zoning allows some commercial uses with a special permit.</p><p>The Neighborhood Conservation zoning the planning unit is seeking would freeze the neighborhood’s current zoning from Race Street to Summit Street and not allow any new commercial interests to establish there.</p><p>“It means that it is going to stay just like it is unless a person tears down a house,” said Gainesville Mayor Myrtle Figueras, who has been active in the rezoning effort. “If they tear it down … it has to be rebuilt as a single-family home.”</p><p>For the past few months, the planning unit’s steering committee members have been knocking on neighbors’ doors to ask them to agree to rezone the neighborhood to keep any new businesses out.</p><p>“It is long, tedious, and hard because I tell you we’ve been working since 2007, but we have gotten 93 percent … of the people to say yes to rezone this,” Figueras said.</p><p>Of the 129 properties, at least 120 approve of the rezoning. The owners of four properties have declined, and the remaining five were not reached.</p><p>And since not all of the property owners in the area have agreed to the rezoning, the City Council is initiating the rezoning. Figueras filed an application on behalf of the council on Aug. 28, and the request will go before the city’s Planning and Appeals Board in October, said Gainesville’s Special Projects Manager Jessica Tullar.</p><p>The group hopes to do something similar in the Newtown area once the rezoning between Race and Summit streets is complete, Figueras said.</p><p>“We understand progress, but this gives us a chance to keep progress confined to a certain area,” Turner said</p>",

As I am relying on my own memory, I am sure that I will have some people and times historically wrong. I also realize that there are people that I will leave out, as I just don’t recall at the time of this writing.</p><p>My apology for any errors or omissions you may find. There are many more outstanding players not mentioned here that contributed to the success of Fair Street and Butler High School Tigers Football Teams.</p><p>Having just recently attending funeral services for former Fair Street and Butler High Schools football coach Cabbell, many thoughts ran through my mind. I had the privilege of sitting with Mr. and Mrs. Cabbell on July 29th and 30th. We visited them at Forsyth County Hospital in Winston Salem. I was amazed at Mr. Cabbell’s memory of times and people (players) in Gainesville. His final service caused me to reflect back:</p><p>My early memories was going out to City Park on Friday nights during football season and watching Heyward Clyde, Shot-Bug, Noble Ross, Bear Jackson and many other players. I had even fonder memories when I was able to root for the Tigers when two of my cousins began playing, Robin and Raymond Hudson. Both of them kicked for the Tigers during their time and that inspired me to want to kick. I enjoyed watching Robert Cantrell, Asbury Turner, Tuck Turner, William Johnson, among a few names that I can recall from that era.</p><p>Then there was the Championship Years (1956 &amp; 57) brought on even more excitement to Fair Street as the Tigers, lead my Cecil Young, Arthur Moss, Clearance (Big Hanes) Niles, John Keith, Eugene Carrithers, Ellis Cantrell, Eddie Strickland, David Camp, Marshal Carter, Cluster Smith, Willie Ed Stephens, and a host of others. And speaking of David Camp, he was, without a doubt, the best kicker/punter in the history of Fair Street High School.</p><p>The Fair Street Tigers, under Coach Cabbell’s leadership, is the only Gainesville public high school teams to win back to back State Championships.</p><p>Mr. Cabbell, in my opinion, did one of his finest coaching jobs when he led the 1958 team to another winning season. That year marked the year that eligibility rules (high school equivalent years played) was adopted. This rendered a number of talented players from the championship teams ineligible to play. Among the players lost were Big Hanes Niles, and Grady (Rip) Thomas. Oscar Ivory took over as quarterback and was, on some special plays, replaced by Eugene Carrithers. Eugene Carrithers, Douglas Young, and Cluster Smith were leaders of the team as seniors.</p><p>The 1959 season saw the emergence of Larry Ivory as the primary running back. Larry was joined in the backfield by Odell Wimpye. I considered Larry Ivory as our Mister Inside due to his powerful runs and Odell Wimpye as Mister Outside due to his speed. Larry was a versatile player, he ran with power, had some of the moves in the open field that we saw in Eugene Carrithers, and was almost as fast as Odell Wimpye. In addition to running back, Larry also played middle linebacker on defense. Key players on this team were Curtis Wright and Richard Brooks. Those 2 anchored one side of the offensive and defensive lines and were a great team. Fred Stovall emerged as center on offense. I always wondered how a player as light as Fred (Dinky) Stovall was able to play center and not miss a single game due to injury. Dinky was a very mischievous player. Dinky would always sneak up on unsuspecting defenders and throw a vicious block. During my years as punter for Fair Street, I can only recall one time that Dinky made a bad snap (pros aren’t that good). Dinky playing center with his size was another testimony to Coach Cabbell’s leadership. I can think of no other coach that would allow a player that size to play the center position. I always considered William Johnson to have been a very good center. William had the size to play the position and played it well in the championship years. Dinky played the position much like William played it. Other key players were Melvin Faulkner, Curtis Young, Loren Hester, James Hemphill, Curtis Wright and Richard Brooks (again), and Leonard Harbin.</p><p>In 1960, Mr. Cabbell found another gem of a runner. No one ever thought of Roger Smith as running back. Players with his size had normally excelled as offensive and defensive linemen at Fair Street. Mr. Cabbell saw the potential in Roger (who later became known as Big Red) and developed him into a highly accomplished fullback. Big Red had a combination of size, power, and speed.

We had to travel down to Marietta to play the Lemon Street High Hornets for the North Georgia Championship. What made this such an intriguing game was the fact that over two months earlier, Marietta had beaten us by a score of 32-6. Before we left the Lemon Street Gym that night, Mr. Cabbell said, “only one team in Georgia would beat Lemon Street this year”, asked who, Mr. Cabbell said, “us”!</p><p>Marietta went undefeated; we lost one other game, a 19-14 defeat to Decatur. In doing so, Lemon Street and Butler High won our respective Conferences. This set up the championship game between us. On Thanksgiving Day, the Green Bay Packers played the Detroit Lions in the annual Thanksgiving Day NFL Game. Green Bay was undefeated going into the game, and Detroit had a losing record. Our Assistant Football Coach was Mr. Emory Lightfoot. He was in charge of our defense. He watched the Packer/Lions game in which the Lions upset the Packers by playing, for that era, a new defense called the “gap defense.” Rather than lining the defensive linemen’s head on the offensive linemen, Detroit played off the outside shoulders of the Packer’s offensive linemen. This was very effective; Detroit bottled up Hornung and Taylor and went on to defeat Green Bay by a score of 26-14.</p><p>The next morning Mr. Lightfoot had us practice this defense for the game we were going to play that night in Marietta. It worked perfectly for us. We were able to stop Marietta’s powerful offense, led by quarterback Zelman Freeman and running back Jackie Menefee. Marietta had other potent weapons in Harold and Donald Bates, Cecil Blount, Roosevelt Phillips, his brother (Chopper), and a host of others.</p><p>In our first meeting, Marietta got their scoring started by blocking my first punt. Roosevelt Phillips burstthrough the center of our line and when Icame through with the punt,there he was slapping the ball back beyond me. We called Roosevelt Phillips “Tooth Pick” because he played the entire game with a tooth pick in his mouth. They went on to a 26-0 halftime lead. Inthe second half, we played to a 6-6 tie.</p><p>In thechampionship game, Tooth Pick again burst through the line and blocked my first punt, Lemon Street went on to score first. Although it was an away game, we had almost as many fans in the stands as they had. During our week of practice leading up to the game, Mr. Cabbell had come up with an offensive play. The play was a direct snap through Richard Wright’s legs to Roger Smith (Big Red). We had James Willie Mack (Big Doole) as a reciever. Big Doole would run to the first down stick andBig Red would arch a pass (alley oop) toBig Doole. This play worked several times in the first half. Lemon Street started cheating towards Big Doole’s side of the field.After Marietta scored, Big Red looked at Big Doole and saw a host of Hornets covering him, he then looked at me in the right flat, I was uncovered so hehit me with the pass. I was able to run the ball down to the 2 yard line before Jackie Menefee caught me (I actually passedout, fainted!). Melvin Tanner had to come in to take my place as I was stillout of iton the bench.On the next play we were called for “clipping”, at that time, a 15 yard penalty, moving the ball back to the 17. On the next play, Richard found Melvin Tannerrunning free deep in the end zone and hit himfor the touchdown. Melvin made a beautiful catch, finger tip grab. We were back in the game, Tigers 7, Hornets 6.</p><p>We traded touchdowns from then on, and wound up winning the game 19-18. Strange thing, but on every try for point after touchdown, Marietta ran the same play, an off tackle slant to Jackie Menefee. The play was run to theleft side of our defense, that’s where I played defensive end, Jerry (mybrother) played linebacker, Rogers Stephens played tackle and Big Red was the middle linebacker. We bottled the play up each time and denied them any extra points. We also had a goal line stand in the game that took the life out of the Hornets.</p><p>In looking back on that great night, several things worked out of us:</p><p>1. We were determined to beat Marietta. For five years preceeding the blow out of 1962, Lemon Street and Fair Street/Butler High games ended in ties, 13-13, 6-6, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0;</p><p>2. Our coaches did an outstanding job preparing us for this game;</p><p>3. Our community came out to support us, driving from Gainesville down to Marietta;</p><p>4. Neither team wanted to go onto the field first, the referees had to put both teams on the clock with a threat of penalty if we did not come out. When we came out, both teams hit the field at the same time, the cheers was deafening;</p><p>5. Our band was louder than Lemon Street’s Band, Mr. Camp had them fired up;</p><p>6. Mrs. Amanda Keith (Deborah’s Mother) promised to bake cakes for the team if we won!!</p><p>We did it!!!!!!!</p>",

If one suffers, we all suffer. We all have sinned and fallen short. As I think about all the organizations and people calling out to disrespect and do harm in their various ways to our own Michael Vick, I want him to know that he still has people that care for him. Yes, we realize that mistakes were made, but why is this witch hunt to hurt him? I would have thought PETA, FBI and others would have better things to do, but I was wrong. We should help one of our own to overcome these problems instead of ostracizing him. I didn’t care for that columnist the other day talking about rooting for another team. We must learn to win, lose or draw with what we have. Maybe he, the columnist, needs to move on and root for the team of his choice. But why try to influence others of your ideas? He is entitled to his opinion. Love being the greatest thing we could ever offer anyone, why not show some love to Michael Vick? It wasn’t that long ago that black men were being lynched and no one cared for their life. We love you Michael and are with you. The Rev. Earnest Mason Gainesville Originally published Tuesday, July 24, 2007</p>",

And yet in a way, it seems like eons ago, and I wonder where all the years went. I know that I lived them all…<br />And I have glimpses of how it was back then and of all my hopes and dreams… But, here it is..the winter of my life and it catches me by surprise… How did I get here so fast? Where did the years go and where did my babies go? And where did my youth go?</p><p>I remember well… seeing older people through the years and thinking that those older people were years away from me and that winter was so far off that I could not fathom it or imagine fully what it would be like… But, here it is…my friends are retired and really getting gray…they move slower and I see an older person now. Lot’s are in better shape than me… but, I see the great change… Not like the ones that I remember who were young and vibrant… but, like me, their age is beginning to show and we are now those older folks that we used to see and never thought we’d be.</p><p>Each day now, I find that just getting a shower is a real target for the day! And taking a nap is not a treat anymore…it’s mandatory! Cause if I don’t on my own free will…I just fall asleep where I sit!</p><p>And so, now I enter into this new season of my life unprepared for all the aches and pains and the loss of strength and ability to go and do things that I wish I had done but never did!!</p><p>But, at least I know, that though the winter has come, and I’m not sure how long it will last…This I know, that when it’s over…its over….Yes , I have regrets .There are things I wish I hadn’t done ,,,,,things I should have done. But indeed, there are many things I’m happy to have done Its all in a lifetime.. .</p><p>So, if you’re not in your winter yet…let me remind you, that it will be here faster than you think. So, whatever you would like to accomplish in your life please do it quickly! Don’t put things off too long!!</p><p>Life goes by quickly So, do what you can today, as you can never be sure whether this is your winter or not!</p><p>You have no promise that you will see all the seasons of your life..so, live for good today and say all the things that you want your loved ones to remember…and hope that they appreciate and love you for all the things that you have done for them in all the years past!!</p><p>“Life is a gift to you.The way you live your life is a gift to those who came after. Make it a fantastic one.”</p><p>LIVE IT WELL!!—-ENJOY TODAY!!!!—–DO SOMETHING FUN!!!—-BE HAPPY!!!—-BE THANKFUL!!!!!</p><p>Creativity is said to be having a short memory of where it came from. I did not write this but do not know the author. I copied it somewhere because it says what I think often now. John</p>",

This is because the human mind does not read every letter by itself, but the word as a whole and the brain figures it out anyway. WOW!</p><p>Rev. Ernest Mason</p><p> </p>",

His seriousness of purpose was perpetually matched by humility, warmth and good cheer. He battled passionately on the Senate floor for the causes that he held dear, and yet still maintained warm friendships across party lines. And that’s one reason he became not only one of the greatest senators of our time, but one of the most accomplished Americans ever to serve our democracy.</p><p>I personally valued his wise counsel in the Senate, where, regardless of the swirl of events, he always had time for a new colleague. I cherished his confidence and momentous support in my race for the Presidency. And even as he waged a valiant struggle with a mortal illness, I’ve benefited as President from his encouragement and wisdom.</p><p>His fight gave us the opportunity we were denied when his brothers John and Robert were taken from us: the blessing of time to say thank you and goodbye. The outpouring of love, gratitude and fond memories to which we’ve all borne witness is a testament to the way this singular figure in American history touched so many lives.</p><p>For America, he was a defender of a dream. For his family, he was a guardian. Our hearts and prayers go out to them today — to his wonderful wife, Vicki, his children Ted Jr., Patrick and Kara, his grandchildren and his extended family.</p><p>Today, our country mourns. We say goodbye to a friend and a true leader who challenged us all to live out our noblest values. And we give thanks for his memory, which inspires us still.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>President Barack Obama</p>",

Something essential is being avoided here and the present course of reform will inevitably result in the same old model, or worse rationing health care and raising taxes.</p><p>The trillion-dollar healthcare industry is pleased to make minor adjustments without fundamental changes because it is motivated primarily by profits. Through its billion-dollar campaigns and advertising, the general public is sold misleading health protection and conditioned to falsely believe that as we age, it is normal to have some type of medical or mental condition requiring medication and unnecessary procedures.</p><p>Don’t misunderstand; drugs and surgery are excellent in emergency situations such as a heart attack or auto accident, but the FDA’s claim that only drugs can prevent or cure diseases is untrue and grossly misleading. Drugs, whether legal or illegal, are used to suppress symptoms and pains.</p><p>Oh, by the way, studies show that Americans are more addicted to the pharmaceuticals in their medicine cabinets than the illegal drugs on the streets. If all we’re doing is numbing our pains and masking symptoms without listening to their messages, it’s like cutting the wires to a fire alarm during a home fire and going back to sleep. We are afraid to honestly deal with the causes of our bad health because to do so requires making fundamental changes in lifestyle and diet. Simply put, we are addicted to the way things are.</p><p>Listen, folks, we have reached a defining time in history when the universe will no longer tolerate us avoiding the causes of problems. Every pillar (including health) of society is being challenged and transformed.</p><p>For example, the lesson we are learning from eight years of the Bush-Cheney administration is that America’s war machine and the same old political strategies will serve us little in the future if we fail to address the underlying causes of violence and hatred.</p><p>The same principle applies to health care; the old standardized method of treating illness and disease with drugs and surgery will not help us become healthier. This principle is critical to every challenge we face, from personal relationships to the national crisis.</p><p>We need more updating health care principles to a more holistic science, quantum physics, not the outdated Newtonian physics that captures the uniqueness and wholeness of the human being. The truth that nobody really talks about, especially those invested in the status quo, is that most chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular and obesity can be prevented and, in many cases, healed with alternative treatments.</p><p>Political and big money interests collude to prevent, discredit and criminally prosecute anyone who claims to treat, prevent or heal illness or disease without using the traditional medical model or approval by government agencies such as the FDA and FTC. We should be asking, who is being protected here, the American public or big business?</p><p>If it was about infusing health care with higher principles, then lobbyists in Washington would not have a stronger, louder voice than we do. “Corporate socialism” and “protectionism” is alive and well in America, but you’ll never hear this from the mainstream media, especially from right-wing, millionaire radio and TV hosts.</p><p>Finally, in addition to our addiction to suppressing symptoms and pains with overmedication and needless procedures, we are becoming even sicker by manmade chemicals and toxins added to food.</p><p>For example, we have entire generations that never heard of “the milkman” who used to deliver whole milk to our homes. They don’t know that such persons are extinct today because the dairy industry came up with a way to increase profits by “homogenizing” milk. In this way, its “shelf-life” was extended to sell in stores in greater volume.</p><p>The downside is that studies show that this modified food product can cause cardiovascular and digestive problems. Now, I’m certainly not suggesting that we stop drinking milk (I use it in my food), but the point is virtually everything we eat, if not organic, is loaded with additives, and chemicals, including growth hormones, to increase the bottom line of the manufacturers. Their effects are gradual and cumulative, but what’s more scary, this is done without public awareness or say so.</p><p>I’m convinced that the above is the only meaningful and effective way to approach reform in health care. It certainly explains why we’ve debated this issue for 40 years, and nothing really changed. Good health and quality of life have yet to play a serious part in mainstream American culture.</p><p>However, the good news is, increasingly, Americans are turning to holistic medicine despite the fear tactics used to prevent it. We can change this insanity only if our voices in Washington are stronger than the special interests.</p><p>Harold Lott is a Gainesville resident and frequent columnist.</p>",

Links are certainly welcome. –ed)<br />2-10-3</p><p><br />The Life &amp; Legacy of Frederick Douglass<br />William S. Connery<br />World and I<br />Born a slave in Maryland, Frederick Douglas eventually escaped to freedom. His lifelong struggles for liberty and the rights of others have become a stirring episode in the darkest chapter of American history.</p><p>A modern painting of Frederick Douglass by Richard Hunt.<br />On November 13, 2002, at Adrian College, Michigan, Frederick Douglass IV and his wife, B.J., announced that they were embarking on a mission to empower young people. “We’re celebrating my great-great-grandfather’s escape from slavery–on September 3, 1838–by taking what we think is a vital message to America’s young people,” said Douglass. “We tell them that if Frederick Douglass could come into this world as a totally impoverished slave and transform himself into an orator, author, member of the middle class, and confidant of presidents, then their potential–in an era of free access to public education–is unlimited. But they must begin charting their successful futures today.<br />“We hope to inspire and empower 165,000 young people to develop their reading, writing, arithmetic, and public speaking skills. We hope to admonish young people to preserve their brains by abstaining from drugs, drinking, and wallowing in self-pity; advise them to use Wait Power by deferring their involvement in premarital sex and other distracting activities; and encourage young people to begin charting their successful futures today, by planning to attend college or a trade school and/or to become entrepreneurs.”<br />“We want to uplift and empower a thousand young people for each of the years that have passed since Frederick Douglass empowered himself by fleeing from slavery,” added B.J. “We believe that each young person whose life we touch will go out and influence other youths to transform their lives for the better. Ultimately, we hope there will be a cumulative effect, compounding social interest on this investment in youth, that will have tremendous benefits for all Americans.”<br />“We have chosen to come to Adrian College to announce the ‘Frederick Douglass 165 Years of Freedom Tour’ [a variety of presentations and performances featuring Douglass IV and his wife] because we believe in the mission of the Sojourner Truth Technical Training Center,” said Douglass IV. “We think that it is imperative to document and preserve the awesome history of Underground Railroad activities in Michigan through the use of computers, digital video, still cameras, and other futuristic technology. My great-great-grandfather was also active in the Underground Railroad in Michigan and spoke at various locations in this region.”<br />The Years of Freedom Tour culmination will take place on September 3, 2003, during the national Frederick Douglass Freedom Day observance. “The central idea of the celebration,” said Douglass, “involves encouraging young people to strengthen their reading, writing, and public speaking skills through live presentations in front of audiences. Part of the celebration involves encouraging people throughout America to read The Narrative of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave: Written by Himself, which is an inspiring book.”<br />Douglass IV was born in Pennsylvania and came to Baltimore in 1965 to enroll at Morgan State University (then Morgan College). His ancestor’s statue graces the campus. After a varied career in the private and public sectors, Douglass IV became Morgan’s director of public relations. Starting in 1997, he and B.J. began portraying Frederick and Anna Douglass in powerful dramatic presentations. They also conduct workshops in conjunction with their performances. These sessions are structured, they explain, “to encourage participants from differing racial, gender, and age groups to engage in dialogues that promote greater understanding of how we must change to become more sensitive and caring Americans. We must come to understand that we are all Americans.”<br />Douglass IV is also a leading proponent of preserving and commemorating the memory of Frederick Douglass in Baltimore. “This was his home,” he explains simply. Despite harsh memories and a long exile, Frederick always considered himself a Marylander. He regarded Baltimore as his hometown and thought of his years in Fells Point as formative, the foundation of all that he eventually became.<br />His early life Frederick Douglass was born in Talbot County, on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, in either 1817 or 1818. His mother was a slave woman named Harriet Bailey. His father, a white man, is unknown, though it was probably Aaron Anthony, the manager of the plantations of Edward Lloyd V, Bailey’s white owner. There was no birth certificate for Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey. Born a slave, he came into this world considered little more valuable than livestock.<br />Young Frederick lived mostly with his grandmother, Betsey Bailey. He barely knew his mother. She was forced to work twelve miles away on a neighboring farm, and could only visit her child at night, after finishing her own work and walking from farm to farm.</p><p>Frederick Douglass IV and his wife, B.J., portray Frederick and Anna.<br />Harriet always referred to Frederick as her “little Valentine,” so he adopted February 14 as his birthday. When he was seven his grandmother took him to the Main House, where he became one of the household slaves. There he began to encounter the evils of slavery more directly. One incident had particular impact. His Aunt Hester was caught out of the house in the company of a young male slave. For this transgression she was tied and whipped until her blood flowed. Thinking he was next, Frederick hid in a closet, hearing Hester’s shrieks and Anthony’s curses as he administered the flogging.<br />Shortly thereafter something happened to Frederick that he later declared an “act of Providence.” He was sent to Fells Point in Baltimore to be a slave to Hugh Auld, the brother of Anthony’s son-in-law. (Anthony’s daughter Lucretia, who in some respects served as Frederick’s protector on the plantation, was married to a ship’s captain named Thomas Auld.)<br />Frederick was grateful to escape from the farm and travel across the Chesapeake Bay. Baltimore had a large population of free blacks, and he discovered that slaves were generally better treated in the city. He attributed this phenomenon to the fact that there were many people around to observe how slaves were managed.<br />Douglass later wrote that “going to live at Baltimore laid the foundation, and opened the gateway, to all my subsequent prosperity. I have ever regarded it as the first plain manifestation of that kind providence which has ever since attended me, and marked my life with so many favors. … I may be deemed superstitious, and even egotistical, in regarding this event as a special interposition of divine Providence in my favor. … This good spirit was from God, and to him I offer thanksgiving and praise.”<br />Frederick was also enthralled by his new mistress. Sophia Auld was the first white person who actually smiled at and was kind to him. She taught him not to be servile–that he should hold his head up and look people squarely in the eye. She also began to teach him the alphabet and a few simple words. This whole enterprise ended when her husband found out about it. Auld told his wife she had poor judgment. What he said was clearly remembered by Frederick: “If you give a nigger an inch, he will take an ell [45 inches]. A nigger should know nothing but to obey his master–to do as he is told to do. Learning would spoil the best nigger in the world. If you teach this nigger to read, there would be no keeping him. It would forever unfit him to be a slave. He would at once become unmanageable, and of no value to his master.”<br />Frederick had lost his original teacher, but he learned a valuable lesson concerning the importance of education on his own road to freedom. He found time after doing his chores to go outdoors and interact with white children. He would find a piece of chalk, write a letter on a fence, and challenge the others to give him the next letter. In this way, he learned his alphabet.<br />A Soul Awakened<br />When he was around twelve, Frederick bought a book of speeches called The Columbian Orator. He was particularly moved by one dialogue between a master and a slave, where the servant proved the necessity of his being set free. Yet Frederick was perplexed. He began to see that there was perverse truth in what Auld had said. The more he read and learned, the more tormented he felt with his present situation. He had been given a view of his wretched circumstances without hope of a remedy. He realized the hell he was in but had no ladder to escape. He even envied his fellow slaves for their ignorance.</p><p>Anna Douglass, first wife of Frederick Douglas.<br />Another moment of enlightenment came to him one day on the docks of Fells Point. Unasked, he helped two Irishmen unload stone from a ship. One asked him if he were a slave. He answered yes. The Irishman responded that it was shame for such a fine young fellow to be a slave for life. They advised him to run off to the north, where he would be free.<br />Frederick pretended not to understand. He knew that there were treacherous white men who deceived slaves into escape, then would capture and return them to their masters for a reward. But the seed of his eventual freedom, the idea of the possibility of escape, had been planted.<br />While in Baltimore, Frederick also achieved religious awakening. The 1820s and ’30s were a time of preaching throughout the states. Some slaveholders were fearful of allowing slaves to become Christians. Others hoped religion would make blacks more accepting of their fate. The message most white preachers offered was one of resignation and acceptance of their lot. They taught that slavery was the benevolent creation of God and that faithful and obedient slaves would be rewarded in heaven.<br />This is not how Frederick interpreted Christianity. For him it meant the equality of all people before God and deliverance from bondage in this life. Religion taught Frederick to value himself, love others, and work to achieve freedom. His religious faith was life affirming and gave him both comfort and a degree of personal autonomy. In his later years he would have little use for organized religion because of the hypocrisy of many professed believers, who both went to church and supported slavery. Nevertheless, throughout his life, Christianity’s ideals helped inspire his work and guide his actions.<br />Finally, Frederick confronted the need to fight for his freedom. Following Anthony’s death, Frederick was shipped back to Talbot County. There he became a fieldhand and experienced the true suffering of a slave. Hands were forced to work from dawn to past dark, if the moon was bright. Soon thereafter Frederick was hired out to Edward Covey, a well-known “slave breaker.”<br />Covey’s job was to beat Frederick into submission and acceptance of slavery. A slave’s job was very simple: do exactly what the master ordered. For Frederick, who had not experienced field life before, most of the time this was impossible. For six months he was beaten at least once a week.<br />It must be remembered that this happened in the relatively free state of Maryland, less than a hundred miles south of the Mason-Dixon Line. Always hanging over the slave was the possibility of being sold far south, to Alabama or Mississippi, where the conditions were far worse. Submission to beatings was compounded by fear: better the devil you know than the devil you don’t know!<br />At one point Covey almost beat him to death. Subsequently Frederick met another slave who told him to keep a special root with him at all times to ward off beatings from the whites. Shortly after this, Covey attacked him again. This time Frederick fought the overseer to a standstill. About eighteen at the time, Frederick considered this the turning point of his life as a subordinate. He had repelled by force the bloody arm of slavery. He also convinced himself that the next white man to try to whip him would have to kill him.<br />Escape to Freedom<br />After a year under Covey, Frederick was hired out to William Freeland. He felt this new master did treat him more like an individual, but his determination to reach freedom was becoming stronger. Frederick forged passes for a few fellow slaves and himself, allowing them to go to Baltimore for the Easter holidays. Their actual aim was to take a boat up the Chesapeake and escape into Pennsylvania. When the plan was found out, the group was sent to jail. Luckily, Frederick was sent back to Baltimore, not to the horrors of the Deep South.</p><p>This picture of a praying slave on a medallion was first published by Josiah Wedgewood (1730-1795). It was adopted as the seal of the Anti-Slavery Society in London.<br />Auld hired Frederick out and he learned how to caulk ships. During this time he attended a Methodist church on Strawberry Lane (now Dallas Street). He also fell in love with a free black woman named Anna Murray. Eventually Frederick arranged a deal whereby he could hire himself out while paying his master three dollars a week. By<br />the end of August 1837 he had another dispute with Auld. Frederick realized that he would soon be sold south if he did not make a move.<br />With his small savings, and with money from his fiancZe, Frederick bought a sailor’s outfit. He then borrowed travel papers from a black sailor he knew. On September 3, he boarded a train for Wilmington at Canton, just north of Fells Point. When the conductor came around, he showed his paper and bought a ticket. From Wilmington he caught a steamboat to Philadelphia. He felt some sense of freedom entering Pennsylvania but kept going until he reached New York City.<br />He wrote for Anna to come north, and they were married on September 15. Soon afterward Frederick went to New Bedford, Massachusetts, where he attempted to renew his trade as a ship’s caulker. It was there that an abolitionist friend suggested that he change his name from Bailey to Douglass. The name comes from a character in Walter Scott’s novel The Lady of the Lake.<br />As prejudice against blacks was still considerable, Douglass was forced to take on odd jobs. In 1841 he gave his first speech at the Bristol Anti-Slavery Society; soon, he became an agent for the society, traveling throughout the Northeast and Midwest, lecturing against slavery and campaigning for the rights of free blacks. By 1845 it was suggested that he publish his life story, to tell the nation the reality of slavery. Thus he published the first of three autobiographies, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass: An American Slave.<br />Soon he was forced to go abroad to England to escape recapture. He spoke throughout the British Isles concerning the American antislavery movement. In 1846 British supporters purchased his freedom from his former master. So, the following year, Douglass returned to America and settled in Rochester, New York. There he started a weekly newspaper called the North Star. He wrote scathing editorials on a variety of topics, slavery being just one of his targets. About the need to be adamantly concerned about the plight of slaves, he wrote, “Those who profess to favor freedom, and yet deprecate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground.”<br />In 1848 Douglass attended the Seneca Falls Women’s Convention, where he began to advocate equal rights and the vote for women. He considered the handling of women as practically chattel almost as horrific as the inhumane treatment of slaves. The 1850s were spent in publishing, speaking, and working with fellow abolitionists, including John Brown, who tried to convince him to join the raid on Harper’s Ferry. After Brown’s capture and death, Douglass mourned him as being one greater than himself: he was willing to live to free the slaves, but Brown was willing to give his life.<br />Due to his support of Brown, Douglass had to flee the United States once again. He went first to Canada and then to Great Britain. He returned to the States in 1860, after hearing of the death of his eleven-year-old daughter, Annie.<br />The Civil War<br />Immediately after the Civil War began in April 1861, Douglass began to call for the use of black troops to fight the Confederacy. He argued for the establishment of colored regiments in the Union army. President Lincoln’s first concern was preserving the Union, however, so Douglass’ call was not heeded.<br />Douglass saw the Civil War as a struggle between freedom and slavery. For him, the sin of slavery could only be ended if Americans were forced to shed their blood. Brown would be vindicated and blacks could take their place as citizens and equals. It was not until January 1863, following the promulgation of the Emancipation Proclamation, that Gov. John Andrew of Massachusetts was given permission to raise the 54th Regiment of Colored Troops. Douglass became a recruiter, personally enlisting two companies of men, including two of his own sons (Charles and Lewis).<br />Negro recruitment was extremely important for Douglass. Only through black participation in the war, he believed, could abolition and full citizenship for Negroes be established: “Once let the black man get upon his person the brass letters U.S.; let him get an eagle on his button, and a musket on his shoulder, and bullets in his pocket, and there is no power on earth … which can deny that he has earned the right of citizenship in the United States.”<br />In July 1863, Douglass met with Lincoln in the White House to redress the grievances that the black troops were suffering as second-class citizens. Both men had risen from humble origins to become leaders in America. Only days after their meeting, the president ordered that retaliatory measures be taken for every Union prisoner killed or sold into slavery in violation of the rules of law. Before the end of the war, many black soldiers were receiving equal pay and promotions. During the last two years of the war nearly 200,000 African Americans served in Union regiments. When given the chance to fight, blacks proved as brave as anyone. More than 30,000 blacks died fighting for freedom and the Union. After Lincoln’s assassination in April 1865, Mrs. Lincoln presented Douglass with Abe’s cane as a token of respect and admiration.<br />Return to Baltimore<br />Two weeks after Maryland abolished slavery in 1864, Douglass returned to Fells Point to celebrate. It was his first sojourn in his home state since 1838. He contemplated moving back to the city to live but was dissuaded by friends. They warned that he could be assassinated. Although he never again lived in Baltimore, he returned repeatedly over the years to speak, invest, and revisit the scenes of his tumultuous youth.<br />He went to the Strawberry Alley church to join in the emancipation celebration. Sounding a theme of fondness for his home state, he declared that “Maryland is now a glorious free state … the revolution is genuine, full and complete.” He went on to argue that white Marylanders–some of whom were sprinkled throughout the audience–had nothing to fear from racial equality, and that Maryland should move to give blacks the right to vote and hold office. (It was not until 2002, when Republican Michael Steele was elected lieutenant governor, that any African American was voted to statewide higher office in Maryland.)<br />Nine months after speaking at the Strawberry Alley church, Douglass received an even warmer welcome from a group of black Baltimoreans. They, with help from white philanthropists, christened the Douglass Institute as a center for the intellectual advancement of “the colored portion of the community.” Douglass gave the opening speech, touching on postwar race relations, including his disappointed hopes for racial integration and the idea that “wealth, learning and ability … convert a Negro into a white man [in terms of status and rights] in this country. When prejudice cannot deny the black man ability, it denies his race.”<br />In May 1870, after President Grant signed the Fifteenth Amendment giving male blacks the right to vote, Douglass went on a prolonged speaking tour to spread the news. One of his stops was Baltimore. Here he spoke as a homecoming hero to a crowd of twenty thousand at Monument Square. Following the speech, Baltimoreans acclaimed Douglass as “the foremost man of color of our times” and called on him to “return to us, and by the power of his magnificent manhood help us to a higher, broader and nobler manhood.” The following year he returned to visit the shipyards where he had worked and often fought.<br />While he was visiting Washington in 1872, his home in Rochester burned down under suspicious circumstances. At that point he moved his family to the District of Columbia. In 1877 Douglass purchased Cedar Hill, a nine-acre estate in Anacostia where he would spend the remainder of his life. He returned often to Baltimore and in 1891 found that the old Strawberry Alley church had been abandoned by the congregation. He bought the property, demolished the decrepit building, and built five new row houses on its foundation, which he intended as housing for the neighborhood’s shack-dwelling residents. Those houses still stand.<br />The Year of Frederick Douglass<br />Agitate, agitate, agitate!” With these words, Frederick Douglass exhorted a woman’s suffrage meeting on February 20, 1895. After returning to Cedar Hill, he was dramatizing his speech to his second wife, Helen, when he suffered a fatal heart attack. It was just a week past his seventy-seventh birthday, or maybe it was his seventy-eighth. He wasn’t quite sure.<br />Though he didn’t know his own age, this remarkable man had a unique impact on the age in which he lived and this nation’s history. Born a slave, he spent most of his life fighting: first for personal freedom, then for the freedom of his own people, and then for female equality. He always cited his youth in Fells Point as crucial in forming his character and defining his life’s mission.<br />Ironically, in Baltimore, a city that celebrates its connections to Edgar Allan Poe, Babe Ruth, and H.L. Mencken, the heritage of Frederick Douglass is often overlooked or forgotten. Possibly this is because he was originally a slave. The era of slavery is now a part of history that many Americans would like to forget. All the places in Baltimore where Douglass lived and worked–except for the row homes he constructed–are long gone, but efforts to resurrect his memory and legacy are ongoing.<br />New plaques (and possibly a statue) marking a “Frederick Douglass Trail” will be dedicated throughout Fells Point on February 17, 2003. Frederick Douglass IV, Baltimore Mayor Martin O’Malley, and other dignitaries will be there to dedicate the trail and commemorate the life of a man who fought for the freedom of all men and women.<br />During 2003, Douglass IV and his wife will serve as honorary chairpersons of the “Read Across America” campaign in Maryland. They will also be involved in a wide array of other activities.<br />They will join residents of Rochester, New York, to celebrate 2003 as the Year of Frederick Douglass. Centered in Rochester, Baltimore, and Washington, the celebration will focus on Douglass’ call in 1863 for “men of color” to sign up to fight in the Civil War on the side of the Union. A highlight of the celebration will be the U.S. Colored Troops Institute conference. During Frederick Douglass Week–February 14 to 21–numerous celebrations commemorating his birth and death will be held across the United States.<br />The legacy of Frederick Douglass in Baltimore was given a boost when O’Malley declared Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass the Baltimore Book of 2002.The mayor ordered two thousand copies of the Dover Thrift edition and distributed them to middle-school student council members during his visits. O’Malley declared that he chose the book because it stirred his imagination when he first read it in the fourth grade. When he reread it last summer, he was particularly intrigued by Douglass’ equation of the Catholic emancipation cause in Ireland with his struggle to be free of slavery. “It’s a very empowering book,” O’Malley says. “It’s difficult to whine after reading it.”<br />Douglass IV and his wife have been busy distributing copies of the book after talks given in libraries around Baltimore. They hope that it will be adopted as a curriculum staple nationwide. They also frequently perform their play, Frederick and Anna: Alive and in Love.<br />Last year they performed at the Central Branch of the Enoch Pratt Library on September 3, 2002, to celebrate National Frederick Douglass Freedom Day. Lynne Cheney, author and wife of Vice President Dick Cheney, was a distinguished guest at the event. She received the Frederick Douglass Leadership Award for her efforts to promote the study of American history among children for her book Patriotism: An American Primer, which includes a page on Frederick Douglass.<br />“Although Douglass never went to school, he realized how important it was to be able to read and write, to acquire knowledge,” said Cheney. “I can’t think of a story more inspiring than that of Frederick Douglass.”<br />Additional Reading<br />Frederick Douglass, Autobiographies, Library of America, New York, 1994.<br />—-, Life and Times of Frederick Douglass, Collier Books, New York, 1962.<br />—-, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, Dover Thrift Edition, Mineola, New York, 1995.<br />Nathan Irvin Huggins, Slave and Citizen: The Life of Frederick Douglass, HarperCollins, New York, 1980.<br />Douglass T.

I greet you here on the bank of the James River in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and twelve. First, I shall thank you, the gentlemen of the Colony of Virginia, for bringing me here. I am here to help you solve some of your problems with slaves. Your invitation reached me on my modest plantation in the West Indies, where I have experimented with some of the newest and still the oldest methods for control of slaves. Ancient Rome would envy us if my program is implemented. As our boat sailed south on the James River, named for our illustrious King, whose version of the Bible we Cherish, I saw enough to know that your problem is not unique. While Rome used cords of wood as crosses for standing human bodies along its highways in great numbers, you are using the tree and the rope occasionally. I caught the whiff of a dead slave hanging from a tree a couple of miles back. You are not only losing valuable stock by hangings, but you are also having uprisings, slaves are running away, your crops are sometimes left in the fields too long for maximum profit, you suffer occasional fires, and your animals are killed. Gentlemen, you know what your problems are; I do not need to elaborate. I am not here to enumerate your problems; I am here to introduce you to a method of solving them. In my bag here, I HAVE A FULL PROOF METHOD FOR CONTROLLING YOUR BLACK SLAVES. I guarantee every one of you that if installed correctly, IT WILL CONTROL THE SLAVES FOR AT LEAST 300 hundred YEARS. My method is simple. Any member of your family or your overseer can use it. I HAVE OUTLINED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENCES AMONG THE SLAVES, AND I TAKE THESE DIFFERENCES AND MAKE THEM BIGGER. I USE FEAR, DISTRUST, AND ENVY FOR CONTROL PURPOSES. These methods have worked on my modest plantation in the West Indies, and it will work throughout the South. Take this simple little list of differences and think about them. On top of my list is “AGE,” but it’s there only because it starts with an “A.” The second is “COLOR” or shade; there is INTELLIGENCE, SIZE, SEX, SIZES OF PLANTATIONS, STATUS on plantations, ATTITUDE of owners, whether the slaves live in the valley, on a hill, East, West, North, South, have fine hair, course hair, or is tall or short. Now that you have a list of differences, I shall give you an outline of action, but before that, I shall assure you that DISTRUST IS STRONGER THAN TRUST AND ENVY STRONGER THAN ADULATION, RESPECT, OR ADMIRATION. The Black slaves, after receiving this indoctrination, shall carry on and will become self-refueling and self-generating for HUNDREDS of years, maybe THOUSANDS. Don’t forget you must pitch the OLD black Male vs. the YOUNG black Male and the YOUNG black Male against the OLD black male. You must use the DARK skin slaves vs. the LIGHT skin slaves and the LIGHT skin slaves vs. the DARK skin slaves. You must use the FEMALE vs. the MALE. And the MALE vs. the FEMALE. You must also have you white servants and overseers distrust all Blacks. But it is NECESSARY THAT YOUR SLAVES TRUST AND DEPEND ON US. THEY MUST LOVE, RESPECT, AND TRUST ONLY US. Gentlemen, these kits are your keys to control. Use them. Have your wives and children use them; never miss an opportunity. IF USED INTENSELY FOR ONE YEAR, THE SLAVES THEMSELVES WILL REMAIN PERPETUALLY DISTRUSTFUL.</p><p>Thank you, gentlemen.”</p>",

Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct-action campaign that was “well timed” in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now, I have heard the word “Wait!” It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This “Wait” has almost always meant ‘Never.” We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that “justice too long delayed is justice denied.”</p><p>We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God-given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jet-like speed toward gaining political independence, but we stiff creep at a horse-and-buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging dark of segregation to say, “Wait.” But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she can’t go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five-year-old son who is asking: “Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?”; when you take a cross-county drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading “white” and “colored”; when your first name becomes “nigger,” your middle name becomes “boy” (however old you are) and your last name becomes “John,” and your wife and mother are never given the respected title “Mrs.”; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you no forever fighting a degenerating sense of “moodiness” then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience… You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court’s decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in public schools, at first glance, it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws. One may ask: “How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?” The answer is that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the Brat to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that “an unjust law is no law at all” Now, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man-made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with moral law. To put it in terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an “I-it” relationship for an “I-thou” relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. Hence segregation is not only politically, economically, and sociologically unsound, it is morally wrong and awful. Paul Tillich said that sin is separation. Is not segregation an existential expression ‘of man’s tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? Thus, it is that I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court, for it is morally right, and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances, for they are morally wrong.</p><p>Let us consider a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself. This is a difference made legal. By the same token, a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal. Let me give another explanation. A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama, which set up that state’s segregation laws, was democratically elected? Throughout Alabama, all sorts of devious methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and there are some counties in which, even though Negroes constitute a majority of the population, not a single Negro is registered. Can any law enacted under such circumstances be considered democratically structured? Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance that requires a permit for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protest. I hope you are able to ace the distinction I am trying to point out. In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist? That would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that their conscience tells him is unjust and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice is, in reality, expressing the highest respect for law.</p><p>Of course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience.</p><p>It was evidenced sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar on the ground that a higher moral law was at stake. It was practiced superbly by the early Christians, who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks rather than submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience. In our own nation, the Boston Tea Party represented a massive act of civil disobedience….</p><p>Never before have I written so long a letter. I’m afraid it is much too long to take your precious time. I can assure you that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing from a comfortable desk, but what else can one do when he k alone in a narrow jail cell other than write long letters, think long thoughts and pray long prayers? If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the truth and indicates an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me. If I have said anything that understates the truth and indicates my having patience that allows me to settle for anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me. I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil rights leader but as a fellow clergyman and a Christian brother. Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-drenched communities, and in some not-too-distant tomorrow, the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.” Yours for the cause of Peace and Brotherhood, MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

The most important laws required that public schools be segregated by race, and that most public places (including trains and buses) have separate facilities for whites and blacks. School segregation was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1954 in Brown v. Board of Education. All the other Jim Crow laws were repealed by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.During the Reconstruction period 1865-1876, federal law provided civil rights protection in the South for Freedmen–the African-Americans who had formerly been slaves. Reconstruction ended at different dates (the latest 1877), and was followed in each Southern state by Redeemer governments that passed the Jim Crow laws to separate the races. In the Progressive Era the restrictions were formalized, and segregation was extended to the federal government by President Woodrow Wilson in 1913.After 1945, the Civil Rights movement gained momentum and used federal courts to attack Jim Crow. The Supreme Court declared de jure public school segregation unconstitutional in 1954. Legal school segregation was known as de jure segregation; it ended in practice in the 1970s. The Court ruling did not stop de facto or informal school segregation, which continues in large cities. President Lyndon B. Johnson, building a coalition of northern Democrats and Republicans, pushed Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which immediately outlawed all Jim Crow laws. Restaurants, hotels and theatres (with rare exceptions) immediately dropped racial segregation.</p><p>Origins of the Jim Crow laws<br />In the first stage of Presidential Reconstruction, all-white Southern legislatures, overwhelmingly dominated by ex-Confederates, abolished laws regarding slavery but passed the black codes, which gave new rights to the Freedmen but fewer than whites possessed. The North reacted against those codes and the Radical Republicans passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866 which gave freedmen legal rights (but not the right to vote). The country by 1870 passed the 14th, and 15th Amendments to the United States Constitution, guaranteeing civil rights and the right to vote. The southern states came under Republican control–a party comprising the Freedmen, white Southerners (“Scalawags“) and migrants from the North (“Carpetbaggers“). The Ku Klux Klan and related groups reacted violently, but they were suppressed by President Ulysses S. Grant using the federal courts. By 1877 the conservatives and Democrats, forming a Redeemer coalition, ousted all the Republican governments. From 1877 down to the 1970s the Democrats controlled every state nearly all the time.After 1877, the Redeemers reversed many of the civil rights gains that black Americans had made during Reconstruction, passing laws that mandated discrimination by both local governments and by private citizens. Since “Jim Crow law” is a blanket term for any of this type of legislation, the exact date of inception for the laws varies by state. The most important laws came in the 1890s and the adoption of legislation segregating railroad cars in New Orleans as the first genuine Jim Crow law. By 1915, every Southern state had effectively destroyed the gains in civil rights and liberties that blacks had enjoyed due to the Reconstructionist efforts.Between 1890 and 1910, many state governments prevented most blacks from voting by various techniques, such as poll taxes and literacy tests. (These could be waived for whites due to grandfather clauses.) It is estimated that of 181,000 African-American males of voting age in Alabama in 1900, only 3,000 were registered to vote. The discriminatory Jim Crow laws were enacted to support racial segregation. They required black and white people to use separate water fountains, public schools, public bath houses, restaurants, public libraries, buses, and rail cars.</p><p>Examples of Jim Crow laws in various states<br />The following examples of segregation (Jim Crow laws) are excerpts from examples of Jim Crow laws shown on a (U.S.) National Park Service website. [1]<br />Note that the examples here include anti-miscegenation laws; though sometimes counted among the “Jim Crow laws” of the South, those laws had also existed outside the South for many years. Anti-miscegenation laws were not repealed by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but were declared unconstitutional in the 1967 Supreme Court case Loving v. Virginia.<br />An African American drinks out of a segregated water cooler designated for “colored” patrons in 1939 at a streetcar terminal in Oklahoma City<br />Alabama<br />Nurses.

Board of Education (1954), to refer to the phrase “equal but separate” used in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) as a custom of de jure racial segregation enacted into law. The NAACP, led by later Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, was successful in challenging the constitutionality of Plessy and the Court voted to overturn 60 years of law under Plessy.After the American Civil War (18611865) brought about the end of slavery, Plessy became the de-facto standard throughout the U.S. Southern states, and represented the institionalization of the segregation period. African-Americans and European-Americans would receive the same services (schools, hospitals, water fountains, bathrooms, etc.), but that there would be distinct facilities for each race. In practice, the services and facilities reserved for African-Americans were frequently of lower quality than those reserved for whites; for example, many African-American schools received less public funding per student than nearby white schools.The legitimacy of such laws was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1896 case of Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537. The repeal of “separate but equal” laws was a key focus of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. In Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the Supreme Court outlawed segregated public education facilities for blacks and whites at the state level; the companion case of Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 outlawed such practices at the Federal level in the District of Columbia.It was also used in apartheid South Africa to claim services for blacks were as good as services for whites.</p><p>Discrimination<br />From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br />This article is about discrimination in the social science sense. For the act of distinguishing/discriminating between things, see distinction, difference, comparison or differentiation. The word discrimination comes from the Latin “discriminare”, which means to “distinguish between”. To discriminate socially is to make a distinction between people on the basis of class or category without regard to individual merit. Examples of social discrimination include racial, religious, sexual, sexual orientation, disability, ethnic, height-related, and age-related discrimination. Whether a given example of discrimination is positive or negative is a subjective judgment (i.e., in the eye of the beholder). Distinctions between people which are based just on individual merit (such as personal achievement, skill or ability) are generally not considered socially discriminatory. Consequently, prohibitions against such discrimination generally will not prevent a government from acting in a legitimate and justifiable way based upon the merit of an individual person. Social theories such as Egalitarianism claim that social equality should prevail. In some societies, such as the U.S.A., individuals’ civil rights include the right to be free from government-sponsored social discrimination [1]. In contrast, conservative writer and law professor Matthias Storme has claimed that the freedom of discrimination in human societies is a fundamental human right or the basis of all fundamental freedoms and, therefore, the most fundamental freedom. Author Hans-Hermann Hoppe, in an essay[2] about his book Democracy: The God That Failed, asserts that a natural social order is characterized by increased discrimination.</p><p>Discrimination and government<br />Many governments have attempted to reduce social discrimination through civil rights legislation and equal opportunity laws. For example, Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights defines the right of individuals to be free from discrimination. Some governments have also institutionalized affirmative action policies (called reverse discrimination by its opponents). Social discrimination in some form by governments is almost universal. For example, government discrimination based on citizenship status is almost always legal. Unemployed citizens may receive welfare benefits funded by taxpayers, while unemployed non-citizens may be denied such benefits. Governments often have the power to forcefully expel non-citizens but cannot expel citizens. Other forms of government discrimination may not be legal yet remain an actuality in practice. Examples of social discrimination by states include: apartheid in South Africa; institutionalized racial segregation in the USA from the Civil War through the 1960s; the “Jewish problem” in Nazi Germany; and reeducation camps in some communist countries.</p><p>Racial discrimination<br />Main article: RacismRacial discrimination differentiates between individuals on the basis of real or perceived racial categories and has been an official government policy in several countries, such as South Africa in the apartheid era.</p><p>In the United States, racial profiling of minorities by law enforcement officials has been called racial discrimination [3].

It turns out he was also a spy for the Union Army, providing key secrets to the North about the Confederacy.\n<img src=\"https://fsbhtiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/art.jackson.loc_.jpg\" alt=\"null\" />\n<br>\nWilliam Jackson, a slave, listened closely to Jefferson Davis' conversations and leaked them to the North.\nWilliam Jackson, a slave, listened closely to Jefferson Davis’s conversations and leaked them to the North.\nJackson was Davis’ house servant and personal coachman. He learned high-level details about Confederate battle plans and movements because Davis saw him as a “piece of furniture” — not a human, according to Ken Dagler, author of “Black Dispatches,” which explores espionage by America’s slaves.\n“Because of his role as a menial servant, he simply was ignored,” Dagler said. “So Jefferson Davis would hold conversations with military and Confederate civilian officials in his presence.”\nDagler has written extensively on the issue for the CIA’s Center for the Study of Intelligence. Video Watch the stories of slaves as spies\nIn late 1861, Jackson fled across enemy lines and was immediately debriefed by Union soldiers. Dagler said Jackson provided information about supply routes and military strategy.\n“In Jackson’s case, what he did was … present some of the current issues that were affecting the Confederacy that you could not read about in the local press that was being passed back and forth across local lines. He actually had some feel for the issues of supply problems,” Dagler said.\nJackson and other slaves’ heroic efforts have been a forgotten legacy of the war — lost amid the nation’s racially charged past and the heaps of information about the war’s historic battles. But historians over the last few decades have been taking an interest in the sacrifice of African-Americans during those war years.\nJackson’s espionage is mentioned in a letter from a general to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell refers to “Jeff Davis’ coachman” as the source of information about Confederate deployments. Video Watch grandson of slaves: “They call me Little Man”\nDagler said slaves who served as spies were able to collect incredibly detailed information, in large part because of their tradition of oral history. Because Southern laws prevented blacks from learning how to read and write, he said, the slave spies listened intently to minute details and memorized them.\n“What the Union officers found very quickly with those who crossed the line … was that if you talked to them, they remembered a great more in the way of details and specifics than the average person … because again they relied totally on their memory as opposed to any written records,” he said.\nJackson wasn’t the only spy. There were hundreds of them. In some cases, the slaves made it to the North, only to return to the South to risk being hanged. One Union general wrote that he counted on black spies in Tennessee because “no white man had the pluck to do it.”\nNo one was better than Robert Smalls, a slave who guided vital supply ships in and out of Charleston Harbor in South Carolina. He eventually escaped and provided the Union with “a turning of the forces in Charleston Harbor,” according to an annual report of the Navy secretary to President Lincoln.\n“A debriefing of him gave … the Union force there the entire fortification scheme for the interior harbor,” Dagler said.\nOne of the most iconic spies was Harriet Tubman, who ran the Underground Railroad, bringing slaves to the North. In 1863, she was asked by the Union to help with espionage in South Carolina. She picked former slaves from the region for an espionage ring and led many of the spy expeditions herself.\n“The height of her intelligence involvement occurred late in 1863 when she actually led a raid into South Carolina,” Dagler said. “In addition to the destruction of millions of dollars of property, she brought out over 800 slaves back into freedom in the North.”\nAs the nation marks Black History Month in February, Dagler said that history should include the sacrifices of the African-Americans who risked their lives for their nation. Many paid the ultimate sacrifice.\n“They were all over the place, and no one [in the South] considered them to be of any value. Consequently, they heard and saw virtually everything done by their masters, who were the decision-makers,” Dagler said.\nWhatever happened to William Jackson, the spy in Jefferson Davis’s house? Unfortunately, that remains a great unknown.\n“He simply disappeared from history, as so many of them have.”",

BOARD OF EDUCATION, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954), the United States’ legal system has sought to address the problem of racial SEGREGATION, or separation, in public schools. In Brown, a unanimous Supreme Court found that segregating children of different races in distinct schools violates the Equal Protection Clause of the FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT, which guarantees that “[n]o state shall deny to any person the EQUAL PROTECTION of the laws” ( 1). In writing the Court’s opinion, Chief Justice EARL WARREN stressed the crucial role education plays in socializing children, and he maintained that racial segregation “generates a feeling of inferiority” in children that will limit their opportunities in life. A related decision, Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 75 S. Ct. 753, 99 L. Ed. 1083 (1955), (Brown II), empowered lower courts to supervise desegregation in local school districts and held that desegregation must proceed “with all deliberate speed.”</p><p>A number of Supreme Court decisions in the decades since Brown have further defined the constitutional claims regarding desegregation first set forth in Brown. In many cases, these decisions have resulted in court-imposed desegregation plans, sometimes involving controversial provisions for busing students to schools outside their immediate neighborhood. Despite such judicial actions, desegregation in the United States achieved mixed success. Although many more children attend school with children of other races now than in 1954, in numerous cities, racial segregation in education remains as high as ever. Faced with the challenges of shifting populations, segregated housing patterns, impatient courts, and the stubborn persistence of racism, comprehensive school desegregationlong a hoped-for remedy to past discrimination against African Americansremains an elusive goal.</p><p>Brown and Brown II inspired a great deal of hope that the races would soon be joined in public schools and that the United States would take a giant step toward healing the racial animosities of its past. THURGOOD MARSHALL, an African American who led the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s Legal Defense Fund in its challenge to school segregation in Brown and later became a justice of the Supreme Court, predicted that after Brown, schools would be completely desegregated within six months.</p><p>Marshall’s statement proved to be wildly optimistic. By 1964, ten years after Brown, a Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) study indicated that only 2.4 percent of African Americans in the South were attending largely white schools. Such statistics indicated that Brown had led to only token INTEGRATION. By the mid-1960s, many observers felt that the Supreme Court, and the United States as a whole, had lost an opportunity to more quickly create a desegregated society. De facto segregation (segregation in fact or actuality)as opposed to de jure segregation (segregation by law)remained a stubborn reality, and racism remained its leading cause. Whites who did not want their children attending school with children of another race found many ways to avoid desegregation, from gerrymandering school boundaries (adjusting school boundaries to their advantage) to manipulating school transportation and construction policies. And in a phenomenon dubbed white flight, many transferred their children to private schools or simply moved to suburbs where few, if any, nonwhites lived.</p><p>Congress joined the Supreme Court in its efforts to assist desegregation, by passing the CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 (28 U.S.C.A. 1447, 42 U.S.C.A. 1971, 1975a to 1975d, 2000a to 2000h-6). Among its many features, the act authorized HEW to create specific guidelines with which to measure the progress of school desegregation. In 1966, for example, these guidelines called for specific levels of integration: 16 to 18 percent of AfricanAmerican children in all school districts must be attending predominantly white schools. The act also allowed HEW to cut off federal funding to school districts that did not meet integration guidelines. However, this punishment proved difficult to use as a means of enforcement.</p><p>In the mid-1960s, a judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, JOHN MINOR WISDOM, issued a number of influential opinions that strengthened the cause of racial integration of schools. Wisdom’s rulings established that it was not enough simply to end segregation; instead, school districts must actively implement desegregation. In one of these cases, United States v. Jefferson Board of Education, 372 F.2d 836 (5th Cir. 1966), he wrote, “[T]he only adequate redress for a previously overt system-wide policy of segregation directed against Negroes as a collective entity is a system-wide policy of integration.” Wisdom’s ruling also detailed measures that the school district must take toward the goal of integration, including deciding how children were to be informed of the schools available to them for attendance, where new schools must be constructed, where transportation routes must run, and how faculty and staff were to be hired and assigned.</p><p>In 1968, the Supreme Court again addressed the issue of school desegregation, in Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S. Ct. 1689, 20 L. Ed. 2d 716, which dealt with the schools of New Kent County, a rural area in eastern Virginia. In its opinion, the Court acknowledged that the integration guidelines set forth in Brown II had not produced adequate results. School districts such as those of New Kent Countywhere in 1967, 85 percent of black children still attended an all-black schoolhad avoided meaningful integration. It was not enough, the Court argued, to simply end segregation and allow a “freedom-of-choice” planby which AfricanAmerican children supposedly had the freedom to attend predominantly white schoolsto be the only means of combining the races in an educational setting. In comments during Court hearings on the case, Chief Justice Warren noted that though the “fence” of outright segregation had been taken down, socially constructed “booby traps” still prevented most children from attending integrated schools.</p><p>In SWANN V. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD OF EDUCATION, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 28 L. Ed. 2d 554 (1971), the focus of school desegregation shifted from largely rural school districts to urban ones, a change of scene that offered new challenges to desegregation. In the rural South before the Brown decision, blacks and whites lived largely in the same communities or areas, and requiring that their children attend the same neighborhood schools could resolve segregation. In urban settings, however, blacks and whites lived in different neighborhoods, so combining the two races in the same schools meant transporting children, usually by bus, to institutions that were often far from their homes.</p><p>In Swann, the Court took the final step toward making busing a part of school desegregation plans, by giving the lower courts power to impose it as a means for achieving integration. Swann involved the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District, in North Carolina, a district in which African Americans made up 29 percent of the student body. After the Supreme Court’s decision in Green, a federal district judge ruled that the school district had not achieved adequate levels of integration: 14,000 of the 24,000 AfricanAmerican students still attended schools that were all black, and most of the 24,000 did not have any white teachers. The judge called for the adoption of a desegregation plan that involved busing 13,300 additional children at an initial start-up cost of over $1 million.</p><p>THE BUSING DEBATE<br />Busing is a plan for promoting school desegregation, by which minority students are transported to largely white schools and white students are brought to largely minority schools. It is intended to safeguard the CIVIL RIGHTS of students and to provide equal opportunity in public education. Busing is also an example of affirmative actionthat is, the attempt to undo or compensate for the effects of past discrimination. Such action is sometimes called compensatory justice.</p><p>Busing was first enacted as part of school desegregation programs in response to federal court decisions establishing that racial SEGREGATION of public schools violates the EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE of the FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT to the Constitution. In Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S. Ct. 1689, 20 L. Ed. 2d 716 (1968), and SWANN V. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD OF EDUCATION, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 28 L. Ed. 2d 554 (1971), the Supreme Court established that federal courts could require school districts to implement busing programs as a means of achieving racial INTEGRATION of public schools.</p><p>However, busing was nothing new in U.S. education. Even before these decisions, nearly 40 percent of the nation’s school children were bused to school. And before 1954, when the Court declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional in BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873, children were often bused to segregated schools that were beyond walking distance from their homes.</p><p>With the Supreme Court decisions in Green and Swann, busing became one of the most controversial topics in U.S. law and politics, particularly in the 1970s. Although the zeal for busing as a remedy for past racial injustice had waned greatly by the 1990s, busing remained a featureif many times a limited oneof most school desegregation programs and continued to inspire heated debate.</p><p>Those who are in favor of busing claim, as did the Supreme Court in Green and Swann, that racial integration in and of itself is a worthy social goal and that busing is an effective means of achieving that goal in public education. Supporters point to the harmful legacy of segregation in education. Before Brown, African-American children were schooled in separate facilities that were usually inferior to the facilities used by whites, despite official claims that they were equal. Such segregation worked to keep African Americans at a disadvantage in relation to whites. It instilled feelings of inferiority in AfricanAmerican children and seriously diminished their educational achievement and opportunities.</p><p>Supporters of busing also often claim that de facto (actual) segregation exists even decades after the CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT and the striking down of racial segregation laws, which occurred in the 1960s. A largely white, wealthy upper class and a largely minority, poor under-class, they argue, are transported, employed, housed, and educated in different settings. Often wealthy people live in the suburbs, and the poor live in the cities. Growing up in their separate neighborhoods, children from higher socioeconomic levels thus have many advantages that poorer children do not: more space at home, better nutrition and HEALTH CARE, greater cultural and intellectual stimulation, and friends and acquaintances with higher social status providing better job and career prospects. Some even compare the isolation of impoverished minorities in the United States’ inner cities with that of impoverished blacks under South Africa’s former apartheid system.</p><p>Advocates of desegregation through busing assert that these existing inequalities must not become greater and that desegregation in education will go a long way toward ending them and creating a more just society. They also point out that U.S. education has historically worked to ensure a society in which class hierarchy is minimized and social mobilityboth upward and downwardis maximized. Busing, they argue, will therefore help avoid the creation of a permanent underclass in the United States.</p><p>Supporters of busing also maintain that it is an affordable way to achieve school desegregation. While admitting that the initial start-up costs of a busing program can be large, they point to statistics that indicate the operating costs of compulsory busing are generally less than five percent of a school district’s entire budget.</p><p>Those who oppose busing make a variety of different points against it, although they do not necessarily oppose integration itself. Opponents claim that busing serves as a distraction from more important educational goals such as quality of instruction. Busing, they hold, too easily becomes a case of form over substance, in which the form of racial integration of education becomes of greater value than the substance of what is actually taught in schools. Critics of busing would rather focus on the environment in a school and in its classrooms than on achieving a particular number of each race in a school. Justice LEWIS F. POWELL JR. echoed these sentiments in an opinion to a school desegregation case, Keyes v. Denver School District, 413 U.S. 189, 93 S. Ct. 2686, 37 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1973). In Keyes, he wrote that in an era of declining student achievement, it is wrong to turn the attention of communities “from the paramount goal of quality in education to a perennially divisive debate over who is to be transported where.”</p><p>Critics also claim that busing causes white flightwhere whites move their children from integrated public schools to private and suburban schools that are largely whitewhich results in an even greater disparity between white and black, rich and poor. According to this scenario, busing only exacerbates the current situation, making public schools and cities even more the exclusive province of the poor.</p><p>Some noted experts on the issue of busing have concluded that although they favor a society that is racially integrated, the social costs of busing and the resulting white flight are too high. Others have sought a middle ground on the issue by arguing that judges should choose carefully the districts in which they decide to implement busing. For example, they claim that white flight is more likely to occur in communities and schools where whites form a small minority, and that as a result, busing has higher social costs in such districts.</p><p>Another prominent complaint in the anti-busing opinion is that court-ordered busing programs represent an abuse of judicial power. According to this view, busing is an example of undesirable judicial activism. The large-scale social changes caused by transporting thousands of children many miles each day should be imposed only by an elected body of representatives such as a state legislature or Congress. Moreover, adherents of this view argue that supervising school desegregation programs only bogs down the courts and takes time away from other pressing legal matters.</p><p>Critics of busing also point out that many times, the same court that requires busing does not provide guidance as to funding it, thereby creating financial headaches for school districts. Related to this issue is the claim that busing is too costly, especially when school districts are forced to purchase new buses in order to start a busing program. In financially strapped school districts, spending on busing sometimes takes away funding for other educational priorities.</p><p>cited:http://law.jrank.org/pages/10023/School-Desegregation-1970s-Swann-Busing.html &lt;a href=”http://law.jrank.org/pages/10023/School-Desegregation-1970s-Swann-Busing.html”&gt;School Desegregation – The 1970s: Swann And Busing&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>Food for thought!!!!

The contest was titled “u @ 50” by AARP. This video won second place. Everyone in the room was awe-struck when they showed it and broke into spontaneous applause. So simple and yet so brilliant. Take a minute and watch it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42E2fAWM6rA</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"720\" height=\"591\" src=\"https://fsbhtiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/128217285_1063977557378234_8403469816699108766_n-2021_03_16-00_48_39-UTC.jpg\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://fsbhtiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/128217285_1063977557378234_8403469816699108766_n-2021_03_16-00_48_39-UTC.jpg 720w, https://fsbhtiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/128217285_1063977557378234_8403469816699108766_n-2021_03_16-00_48_39-UTC-600x493.jpg 600w, https://fsbhtiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/128217285_1063977557378234_8403469816699108766_n-2021_03_16-00_48_39-UTC-300x246.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" />",

yeah, we the same brothers from a long time ago<br />We was talkin’ about television and doing’ it on the radio<br />What we did was to help our generation realize<br />They had to get out there and get busy cause it wasn’t gonna be televised<br />We got respect for you rappers and the way they be free-weighin’<br />But if you’re gon’ be teachin’ folks things, make sure you know what you’re sayin’<br />Older folks in our neighborhood got plenty of know-how<br />Remember if it wasn’t for them, you wouldn’t be out here now<br />And I ain’t comin’ at you with no disrespect<br />All I’m sayin’ is that you damn well got to be correct<br />Because if you’re gonna be speakin’ for a whole generation<br />And you know enough to try and handle their education<br />Make sure you know the real deal about past situations<br />It ain’t just repeatin’ what you heard on the local TV stations<br />…Sometimes they tell lies and put ’em in a truthful disguise<br />But the truth is that’s why we said it wouldn’t be televised<br />They don’t know what to say to our young folks, but they know that you do<br />And if they really knew the truth…why would they tell you?<br />The first sign is peace, tell all them gun totin’ young brothas<br />That the man is glad to see us out there killin’ one another<br />We raised too much hell when they was shootin’ us down<br />So they started poisoning our minds tryin’ to jerk us all around<br />And they tell us they got to come in and control our situation<br />They want half of us on dope and the other half in incarceration<br />If the ones they want dead ain’t killed by what they instigated<br />They put some dope on a brotha’s body and claim it was drug related<br />Tell them drug related means there don’t need to be no investigation<br />Or at least that’s the way they’re gon’ play it on the local TV stations<br />All your 9-millimeter brothas…give them somthin’ to think about<br />Tell them you heard that this is the new word, they got to work that stuff out<br />But somehow they feel in the wrong way with a gun in their hands<br />They feel real independent…but they just pullin’ contracts for the man<br />Five and five will tell you it’s hopeless out there on the avenue<br />But if they really knew the truth…why would they tell you?<br />And if they look at you like you’re insane<br />And they start callin’ you scarecrow and say you ain’t got no brain<br />Or start tellin’ folks that you suddenly gone lame<br />Or that white folks had finally co-opted your game<br />Or worse yet implying that you don’t really know…<br />That’s the same thing they said about us…a long time ago<br />Young rappers, one more suggestion before I get out of your way<br />But I appreciate the respect you give me and what you got to say<br />I’m sayin’ protect your community and spread that respect around<br />Tell brothas and sistas they gotta calm that bullshit down<br />Cause we’re terrorizin’ our old folks and brought fear into our homes<br />And they ain’t got to hang out with the senior citizens<br />Just tell them, Dammit…leave the old folks alone<br />And we know who rippin’ off the neighborhood, tell them, That BS has got to stop!<br />Tell them you’re sorry they can’t handle it out there<br />But they got to take the crime off the block<br />And if they look at you like you’re insane<br />And they start callin’ you scarecrow and say you ain’t got no brain<br />Or start tellin’ folks that you suddenly gone lame<br />Or that white folks had finally co-opted your game<br />Or worse yet saying that you really don’t know…<br />That’s the same thing they said about me a long time ago<br />And if they tell folks that you finally lost your nerve<br />That’s the same thing they said about us, when we said, Johannesburg<br />But I think the young folks need to know, that things don’t go both ways<br />You can’t talk respect of every other song or just every other day<br />What I’m speakin’ on now is the raps about the women folks<br />On one song she’s your African Queen on the next one she’s a joke<br />And you ain’t said no words that I haven’t heard, but that ain’t no compliment<br />It only insults eight people out of ten and questions your intelligence<br />Four letter words or four syllable words won’t make you important<br />It’ll only magnify how shallow you are and let everybody know it<br />And if they look at you like they think you insane<br />Or they call you scarecrow thinkin’ you ain’t got no brain<br />Or start tellin’ folks that you suddenly gone lame<br />Or that white folks have finally co-opted your game<br />Or you really don’t know…They said that about me a long time ago<br />If they finally start to tell people that you lost your nerve<br />That’s what they said about Johannesburg<br />You ain’t insane…you have got a brain<br />You haven’t gone lame; you have got your game<br />Remember…keep the nerve<br />Keep the nerve<br />Keep the nerve<br />Keep the nerve<br />…I’m talkin’ about peace</p><p>…Gil Scott-Heron</p><p>Rev Earnest Mason</p>",

First, being able to read a magazine from almost any era and now being able to listen to music we grew up with. It doesn’t get any better than this. Gainesville was and is a great community to grow up in exemplified by those individuals that make this site what it is. I have a hunch this will be the best reunion ever judging from the participation of the many people that contribute to the site. I can hardly wait. Keep up the good work.</p>",

It seems to be growing by the day. What I find interesting is the boomer reaction to it. Usually, when someone is angry, you try to figure out why.</p><p>There just seems to be this total mentality among the boomers: “I’ll do whatever I want and screw you if you don’t like it.” I am trying to figure out where this came from. What did they hear growing up that made them this way?</p><p>Too much pop psychology? I’m OK; You’re, OK? Disco? What?</p><p>I haven’t stumbled over any other inter-generational rage in other literature. The boomers don’t hate the generation before them. They don’t have blogs or comments to blogs about how rotten the people born before them are. In fact, the people born before them seemed intent on making the world a better place.</p><p>The boomer blogs I have looked at all read the same way. They will have a comment from a pissed-off X or Y and then comment about how it is ‘Tough’, and get over it. They got theirs, and that is all that matters. The boomers just seem to keep taking and telling the rest of the world to go to –ll while they do it.</p><p>They seem truly perplexed that a large amount of rage is building up behind them. I believe at this point; they are ignoring it at their own peril. Well… How does the saying go? First, they ignore you; then they ridicule you, then fight you. Guess we are up to stage 2″…Posted by X-er.</p><p>I can’t help but think that the same folks that protested against the establishment or status quo back in the 60s and 70s are actually protesting against free speech and things now…kind of contradictory to me…I care not about the things some of the new school or generation does, but I have learned to live and let live…seems like someone has too much time on their hands…people want to be themselves, not the “box” other people try to put them in…if people want to go to ___…get out of their way…it’s, unfortunately, their choice to make…the world would be much better…I can’t help to think that people thought Noah was crazy, or Einstein or other innovators…look at it now! They are all in the textbooks for studying…if we would keep our noses out of it…we may actually learn something…most things are discovered by accident anyway…Columbus didn’t discover America…he got lost!!!!… Rev.

Feed this to a baby for colic…When someone in a household had the flu, cut onions in half and place halves in every room of the house…nobody else in the house would come down with the flu…At least twice a year, parents would line up the youngins and give them each a spoonful of 666 and a spoonful of castor oil…believe me, it worked faster than an enema…A sore throat was treated by swallowing a spoonful of sugar with 2 drops of turpentine on it…There are many, many more, but I will stop right here and yield to others…Rev.

Initially, 330 White students and 120 African-American students enrolled in the school system for three months of classes which began on September 12, 1892. Instruction for grades 1-4 was offered to Black students whereas classes in grades 1-7 were offered to White students. Black schools met in the Baptist and Methodist Churches in the Fall of 1892. The Methodist Church housed grades 1 and 4; the Baptist Church housed grades 2 and 3.</p><p>Two African-American male teachers were hired to teach in these schools. In 1893, the following year, the two Black schools were combined, and all classes were held at the Methodist Church.</p><p>Gainesville’s first African-American school building was built by the school board in 1898 near the old Southern train depot. This school was used until the tornado of 1903 destroyed it. Black students again attended schools housed in Black churches until a new building could be constructed.</p><p>Within the decade, a new building was erected for grades 1-8 on the corner of Fair and Hunter Streets. The school, Gainesville Graded and High Colored School, was a one-story wooden building. Since it was located in the Black neighborhood, attendance rapidly increased in the new school which was known unofficially as “Summer Hill”. Two new classrooms and four new teachers were added to “Summer Hill” by 1912. The school was renovated again in 1924.</p><p>On June 1, 1925, Professor W.H. Harper, principal of “Summer Hill” successfully campaigned for the school board for the ninth grade to be added. However, the board did not provide any funding for the new grade. Nevertheless, Professor Harper made the ninth grade available to students. In 1929, 18 Summer Hill Ninth Graders petitioned the Gainesville Board of Education to grant an addition of the tenth grade to “Summer Hill”. The petition was granted with funding resulting in the hiring of a teacher for the new grade.</p><p>By 1934, “Summer Hill” School’s student enrollment was 431. The school was utilized until April 6, 1936, when it was destroyed by a terrible tornado. The school was replaced and renamed in approximately a year’s time. The new school was named Fair Street School. Fair Street School was dedicated on April 21, 1937. A luncheon funded by the Gainesville City Board of Education was included as part of the dedication ceremony.</p><p>And now, fellow classmates and friends, a new structure has been erected as the “new” Fair Street School. I wonder. What will be written in the annals of history about the “new” Fair Street School?</p><p>Join the Forum discussion on this post</p>",

There are many hurdles to be cleared before actual brick-and-mortar is visible. Yesterday, one of many hurdles was cleared in getting planning commission approval to abandon some city-owned property needed in the construction of the school. This process now goes before the city council as yet another hurdle. The question was asked, “how should the tiger look that will grace the gym floor in the new facility? Although our tiger has always been maroon and white, Tarzan’s tigers were usually black and gold. Please give your feedback on how we want the tiger to look. I thought to include more colors in the overall scheme of the logo. Your thoughts?</p><p>FAIR ST.pdf</p>",

No gossip was whispered in the cafeteria.</p><p>It was 1969, and Hall County’s all-black school had been closed due to court-ordered integration, which came long after the 1954 Supreme Court ruling that deemed segregated schools as inherently unequal.</p><p>That fall, hundreds of local black students suddenly found themselves behind desks at Gainesville High School, a place is once forbidden to them.</p><p>The building on Athens Street that had educated a generation and molded their character was history. But for nearly the past 20 years, the Fair Street-Butler Alumni Association resurrected the memories of the county’s black schools with a biennial reunion on Labor Day weekend.</p><p>Gainesville resident Martha Mays graduated from Butler Highs’ last class. She serves as president of the association that orchestrated this year’s three-day reunion, which wraps up with today’s luncheon at the Georgia Mountains Center.</p><p>Mays said the closing of Butler High was bittersweet.</p><p>“We had really hoped that because Butler had a lot of new age things, like air conditioning and a French lab, they would come to our school,” she said, referring to the city’s white students. “But they didn’t. And, of course, we were saddened by the fact that our school was closed. But with integration, there was supposed to be opportunity and progress.”</p><p>Mays said the reunion is when alumni from Fair Street School, once a school for black students in kindergarten through grade 12, and Butler High come together in Gainesville and exchange tales from days.</p><p>Stories of secret crushes, memories of spending lunch money at the sweets shop, and of marching bands crashing through the Gainesville square booming the anthem “Our Boys are Gonna Shine Tonight” resurfaces at the reunion.</p><p>Sometimes, the conversation drifts to the mystery of the whereabouts of Larry Marlow, Butler Highs’ lone white student who dared to cross the line into Gainesville’s southside school. And there are memories of long walks to school up red dirt roads and the stale recollections of denied opportunity.</p><p>Mays, who has never missed a reunion, said she feels it is important for the black school’s alumni to bring their children and grandchildren to the event.</p><p>“It is a part of history. You don’t know where you’re going if you don’t know where you’ve been,” she said. “… This is a way for them not just to hear you talk about it, but see it.”</p><p>Mays said she wants younger generations to understand how it was then.</p><p>“The saying it takes a village to raise a child we were like that. You knew you always had to be respectful and be on Q because somebody was always watching,” she said. “We believe in each one, teach one and we try to pass it on.”</p><p>And it’s just plain fun.</p><p>“I guess we really enjoy each other, and each year, people come who have never been before,” Mays said. “So many of us move away. Very few stay here. And they come back, and it’s so exciting. You have an opportunity to reconnect with people.”</p><p>“We want those people to come back so we can show them how things have changed,” Fair Street-Butler Alumni Association Treasurer Berlinda Lipscomb said.</p><p>When she moved back to Gainesville from Ohio, Mary Acree, 69, started the reunion. Acree graduated from Fair Street in 1959 and recalls the warm community she grew up in.</p><p>“The whole time I was in Ohio, I was thinking about Fair Street and my friends there,” she said. “I just never forgot. It was a wonderful time in my life.”</p><p>As a trumpet player in the Fair Street Band, Acree said she loved it when the band marched through town playing a song “the white folks” loved: “The Beer Barrel Polka.”</p><p>Acree said she really got down at the sock hops held in the Fair Street gym. The Friday night prom and Saturday night sock hop remain staples of the reunion.</p><p>“Oh, Lord, I used to dance,” Acree said. “I was a boogieing woman back then.”</p><p>The music of Jackie Wilson and other soul favorites like Fred Parris and the Five Satins once blared from the Fair Street auditorium.</p><p>“In the Still of the Night, that was a slow song,” Acree remembers.</p><p>As a band member, Acree also traveled the state with the Fair Street football team, which won state championship games in 1956 and 57. The team remains the only public school in Hall County to win back-to-back state titles.</p><p>Celebration of the Fair Street Tigers of 56-57 is this year’s reunion theme. The team and its surviving members were honored at this year’s season-opening Gainesville High football game. The Red Elephant Marching Band even learned the Tiger’s favorite, “Our Boys are Gonna Shine Tonight,” and played the tune as the champions took the field.</p><p>Gene Carrithers, 68, was the Tiger’s halfback during those two title seasons. He said the game was the first time he stepped onto the field at City Park more than a week ago since he sported a football helmet in high school.</p><p>“It took a long time, but that’s something real special,” he said of the ceremony. “Them recognizing us last Friday night, that got that cake. That was really special. That will stay with us. It took a long time, but it got here.”</p><p>Carrithers still cracks a great big smile when he tells the story of the Tigers shutout of Cedartown, their arch rival. Under the leadership of football coach E.L. Cabbell, the young men of Fair Street discovered that champions can come from humble beginnings.</p><p>“All of us came up in the projects out there,” Carrithers said. “All of us played that sandlot football, so we were pretty much together when we got in high school. And everything just fell in place.”</p><p>The former halfback said his football days ended with high school because there were no college scholarships for black athletes at the time. He said he’s glad things have changed but cant help but wonder what might have been.</p><p>“You can make it anywhere now,” he said. “The doors are open.”</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"800\" height=\"543\" src=\"https://fsbhtiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/FS-band-rotated.jpg\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://fsbhtiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/FS-band-rotated.jpg 960w, https://fsbhtiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/FS-band-300x204.jpg 300w, https://fsbhtiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/FS-band-768x522.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" />",

A mystery dinner.</p><p>But not your typical dinner theater – this idea centered around plays on words and different ways to eat the food.</p><p>“Tea on the menu is not tea, it’s called Harbor Bash and I get it from the Boston Tea Party,” Lipscomb said. “Everything is something different than what it is, you just have to use your imagination. You could order your cake first instead of your salad and only a toothpick to eat it with.”</p><p>Guests pay for their seat and participate in a game where they have to choose their dinner from a menu with items like Barnyard, Harbor Bash, High Mountain or Irish Delight.</p><p>“I thought of the idea of a mystery dinner because we want it to be something different because we need to get more than $10,” Lipscomb said. “I found a place that would let me have the dinner free of charge. … It was very nice; it was out on Lake Lanier. One evening, we went out, and our room was completely packed, from wall to wall.”</p><p>Typically, the term “mystery dinner” involves a play, and guests at the dinner help solve the crime. Michelle Schreck, owner of Grapes &amp; Hops Bar &amp; Bistro in Flowery Branch, hosted one recently with members of the South Hall community theater Fifth Row Center.</p><p>“We’re excited about doing them and bringing something different to the whole atmosphere in dining,” said Schreck about the next dinner planned for May 17.</p><p>The restaurant also has hosted a different kind of mystery dinner where guests wear blindfolds while tasting food, and exploring the sensory experience.</p><p>The food helps set the scene, Schrek said.</p><p>“The fascination is that they are getting entertainment at the same time they are having a nice dinner,” she said. “You do a three-course dinner. And I think it’s a little spin on the murder mystery, making it exciting.”</p><p>Like Lipscomb’s fundraising idea, Grapes &amp; Hops also uses the dinner theater event to give back to the community; it’s a fundraiser for Fifth Row Center.</p><p>The murder mystery is called “Eat, Drink &amp; Be Married” and takes place in a Las Vegas Wedding Chapel where a young couple has eloped and the bride’s father, Blackjack White, a wealthy casino owner, isn’t happy.</p><p>Both Schreck’s Mystery Dinner and Lipscomb’s are three courses, but Lipscomb adds a twist to the menu.</p><p>Lipscomb said that guests choose eight items for each of the three courses.</p><p>“They might order their cake, a glass of water and a toothpick,” she said. “It can be as elegant as you want it to be or it can be simple.”</p><p>Usually Lipscomb sends out printed invitations and gets the menus printed, too.</p><p>So after experimenting with several of the mystery dinners, Lipscomb decided they were such a success she wrote a book: “Fun Dinners, Brainteasers: Church and Organization Fundraiser Guide.”</p><p>It’s an instructional guide that can be found on Amazon.com.</p><p>Now, Lipscomb uses this book and the fundraising idea to help her scholarship foundation raise funds for needy students. Her first mystery dinner was a success, raising enough money to build the church’s fellowship hall.</p><p>Lipscomb, the first black female instructor at Lanier Technical College and graduate of the Gainesville school system, retired in 2007. A foundation at Lanier Tech has been set up in her honor, The Shirley Childers Lipscomb Scholarship Fund.</p><p>“There has not been a scholarship handed out yet; we want to get it endowed. … You have to have at least $25,000 or $50,000 in there,” she said.</p><p>But local organizations have really embraced the mystery dinner idea, like the North Georgia Force girl’s basketball team.</p><p>According to Lipscomb, the girls will be competing in a tournament this summer in Florida and needed a fundraiser. They are set to have their mystery dinner on June 5 at the East Hall Community Center. The public is welcome.</p><p> </p>",

College, girls,<br />career, and life itself got in the way. In fact, Jack moved clear across<br />the country in pursuit of his dreams. There, in the rush of his busy life,<br />Jack had little time to think about the past and often no time to spend<br />with his wife and son. He was working on his future, and nothing could stop<br />him.</p><p>Over the phone, his mother told him, ‘Mr. Belser died last night. The<br />funeral is Wednesday.’ Memories flashed through his mind like an old<br />newsreel as he sat quietly remembering his childhood days.</p><p>‘Jack, did you hear me?’</p><p>‘Oh, sorry, Mom Yes, I heard you. It’s been so long since I thought of him.<br />I’m sorry, but I honestly thought he died years ago,’ Jack said.</p><p>‘Well, he didn’t forget you. Every time I saw him he’d ask how you were<br />doing. He’d reminisce about the many days you spent over ‘his side of the<br />fence’ as he put it,’ Mom told him.</p><p>‘I loved that old house he lived in,’ Jack said.</p><p>‘You know, Jack, after your father died, Mr. Belser stepped in to make sure<br />you had a man’s influence in your life,’ she said</p><p>‘He’s the one who taught me carpentry,’ he said. ‘I wouldn’t be in this<br />business if it weren’t for him. He spent a lot of time teaching me things<br />he thought were important…Mom, I’ll be there for the funeral,’ Jack said.</p><p>As busy as he was, he kept his word. Jack caught the next flight to his<br />hometown. Mr. Belser’s funeral was small and uneventful. He had no children<br />of his own, and most of his relatives had passed away.</p><p>The night before he had to return home, Jack and his Mom stopped by to see<br />the old house next door one more time.</p><p>Standing in the doorway, Jack paused for a moment. It was like crossing<br />over into another dimension, a leap through space and time The house was<br />exactly as he remembered. Every step held memories. Every picture, every<br />piece of furniture….Jack stopped suddenly.</p><p>‘What’s wrong, Jack?’ his Mom asked.</p><p>‘The box is gone,’ he said</p><p>‘What box?’ Mom asked.</p><p>‘There was a small gold box that he kept locked on top of his desk. I must<br />have asked him a thousand times what was inside. All he’d ever tell me was<br />‘the thing I value most,” Jack said.</p><p>It was gone. Everything about the house was exactly how Jack remembered it,<br />except for the box. He figured someone from the Belser family had taken<br />it.</p><p>‘Now I’ll never know what was so valuable to him,’ Jack said. ‘I better get<br />some sleep. I have an early flight home, Mom.’</p><p>It had been about two weeks since Mr. Belser died Returning home from work<br />one day Jack discovered a note in his mailbox. ‘Signature required on a<br />package. No one at home. Please stop by the main post office within the<br />next three days,’ the note read.</p><p>Early the next day Jack retrieved the package. The small box was old and<br />looked like it had been mailed a hundred years a go. The handwriting was<br />difficult to read, but the return address caught his attention. ‘Mr. Harold<br />Belser’ it read. Jack took the box out to his car and ripped open the<br />package. There inside was the gold box and an envelope. Jack’s hands shook<br />as he read the note inside.<br />‘Upon my death, please forward this box and its contents to Jack Bennett.<br />It’s the thing I valued most in my life.’ A small key was taped to the<br />letter. His heart racing, as tears filling his eyes, Jack carefully<br />unlocked the box. There inside he found a beautiful gold pocket watch.</p><p>Running his fingers slowly over the finely etched casing, he unlatched the<br />cover. Inside he found these words engraved:</p><p>‘Jack, Thanks for your time! -Harold Belser.’</p><p>‘The thing he valued most was…my time’</p><p>Jack held the watch for a few minutes, then called his office and cleared<br />his appointments for the next two days. ‘Why?’ Janet , his assistant asked.</p><p>‘I need some time to spend with my son,’ he said.</p><p>‘Oh, by the way, Janet, thanks for your time!’</p><p>‘Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments<br />that take our breath away,’</p><p>Think about this. You may not realize it, but it’s 100% true.</p><p>1. At least 2 people in this world love you so much they would die for<br />you.</p><p>2. At least 15 people in this world love you in some way.<br />3. A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they don’t like<br />you.</p><p>4. Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep.</p><p>5. You mean the world to someone.</p><p>6. If not for you, someone may not be living.</p><p>7. You are special and unique.</p><p>8. When you think you have no chance of getting what you want, you probably<br />won’t get it, but if you trust God to do what’s best, and wait on His time,<br />sooner or later, you will get it or something better.</p><p>9. When you make the biggest mistake ever, something good can still come<br />from it.</p><p>10. When you think the world has turned its back on you, take a look: you<br />most likely turned your back on the world.</p><p>11. Someone that you don’t even know exists loves you.<br />12. Always remember the compliments you received. Forget about the rude<br />remarks.</p><p>13. Always tell someone how you feel about them; you will feel much better<br />when they know and you’ll both be happy ..</p><p>14. If you have a great friend, take the time to let them know that they<br />are great.</p><p>Send this letter to all the people you care about, if you do so, you will<br />certainly brighten someone’s day and might change their perspective on<br />life…for the better.</p><p>To everyone I send this to<br />‘ Thanks for your time</p>",

BOARD OF EDUCATION, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954), the United States’ legal system has sought to address the problem of racial SEGREGATION, or separation, in public schools. In Brown, a unanimous Supreme Court found that segregating children of different races in distinct schools violates the Equal Protection Clause of the FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT, which guarantees that “[n]o state shall deny to any person the EQUAL PROTECTION of the laws” ( 1). In writing the Court’s opinion, Chief Justice EARL WARREN stressed the crucial role education plays in socializing children, and he maintained that racial segregation “generates a feeling of inferiority” in children that will limit their opportunities in life. A related decision, Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 75 S. Ct. 753, 99 L. Ed. 1083 (1955), (Brown II), empowered lower courts to supervise desegregation in local school districts and held that desegregation must proceed “with all deliberate speed.”</p><p>A number of Supreme Court decisions in the decades since Brown have further defined the constitutional claims regarding desegregation first set forth in Brown. In many cases, these decisions have resulted in court-imposed desegregation plans, sometimes involving controversial provisions for busing students to schools outside their immediate neighborhood. Despite such judicial actions, desegregation in the United States achieved mixed success. Although many more children attend school with children of other races now than in 1954, in numerous cities, racial segregation in education remains as high as ever. Faced with the challenges of shifting populations, segregated housing patterns, impatient courts, and the stubborn persistence of racism, comprehensive school desegregationlong a hoped-for remedy to past discrimination against African Americansremains an elusive goal.</p><p>Brown and Brown II inspired a great deal of hope that the races would soon be joined in public schools and that the United States would take a giant step toward healing the racial animosities of its past. THURGOOD MARSHALL, an African American who led the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s Legal Defense Fund in its challenge to school segregation in Brown and later became a justice of the Supreme Court, predicted that after Brown, schools would be completely desegregated within six months.</p><p>Marshall’s statement proved to be wildly optimistic. By 1964, ten years after Brown, a Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) study indicated that only 2.4 percent of African Americans in the South were attending largely white schools. Such statistics indicated that Brown had led to only token INTEGRATION. By the mid-1960s, many observers felt that the Supreme Court, and the United States as a whole, had lost an opportunity to more quickly create a desegregated society. De facto segregation (segregation in fact or actuality)as opposed to de jure segregation (segregation by law)remained a stubborn reality, and racism remained its leading cause. Whites who did not want their children attending school with children of another race found many ways to avoid desegregation, from gerrymandering school boundaries (adjusting school boundaries to their advantage) to manipulating school transportation and construction policies. And in a phenomenon dubbed white flight, many transferred their children to private schools or simply moved to suburbs where few, if any, nonwhites lived.</p><p>Congress joined the Supreme Court in its efforts to assist desegregation, by passing the CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 (28 U.S.C.A. 1447, 42 U.S.C.A. 1971, 1975a to 1975d, 2000a to 2000h-6). Among its many features, the act authorized HEW to create specific guidelines with which to measure the progress of school desegregation. In 1966, for example, these guidelines called for specific levels of integration: 16 to 18 percent of AfricanAmerican children in all school districts must be attending predominantly white schools. The act also allowed HEW to cut off federal funding to school districts that did not meet integration guidelines. However, this punishment proved difficult to use as a means of enforcement.</p><p>In the mid-1960s, a judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, JOHN MINOR WISDOM, issued a number of influential opinions that strengthened the cause of racial integration of schools. Wisdom’s rulings established that it was not enough simply to end segregation; instead, school districts must actively implement desegregation. In one of these cases, United States v. Jefferson Board of Education, 372 F.2d 836 (5th Cir. 1966), he wrote, “[T]he only adequate redress for a previously overt system-wide policy of segregation directed against Negroes as a collective entity is a system-wide policy of integration.” Wisdom’s ruling also detailed measures that the school district must take toward the goal of integration, including deciding how children were to be informed of the schools available to them for attendance, where new schools must be constructed, where transportation routes must run, and how faculty and staff were to be hired and assigned.</p><p>In 1968, the Supreme Court again addressed the issue of school desegregation, in Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S. Ct. 1689, 20 L. Ed. 2d 716, which dealt with the schools of New Kent County, a rural area in eastern Virginia. In its opinion, the Court acknowledged that the integration guidelines set forth in Brown II had not produced adequate results. School districts such as those of New Kent Countywhere in 1967, 85 percent of black children still attended an all-black schoolhad avoided meaningful integration. It was not enough, the Court argued, to simply end segregation and allow a “freedom-of-choice” planby which AfricanAmerican children supposedly had the freedom to attend predominantly white schoolsto be the only means of combining the races in an educational setting. In comments during Court hearings on the case, Chief Justice Warren noted that though the “fence” of outright segregation had been taken down, socially constructed “booby traps” still prevented most children from attending integrated schools.</p><p>In SWANN V. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD OF EDUCATION, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 28 L. Ed. 2d 554 (1971), the focus of school desegregation shifted from largely rural school districts to urban ones, a change of scene that offered new challenges to desegregation. In the rural South before the Brown decision, blacks and whites lived largely in the same communities or areas, and requiring that their children attend the same neighborhood schools could resolve segregation. In urban settings, however, blacks and whites lived in different neighborhoods, so combining the two races in the same schools meant transporting children, usually by bus, to institutions that were often far from their homes.</p><p>In Swann, the Court took the final step toward making busing a part of school desegregation plans, by giving the lower courts power to impose it as a means for achieving integration. Swann involved the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District, in North Carolina, a district in which African Americans made up 29 percent of the student body. After the Supreme Court’s decision in Green, a federal district judge ruled that the school district had not achieved adequate levels of integration: 14,000 of the 24,000 AfricanAmerican students still attended schools that were all black, and most of the 24,000 did not have any white teachers. The judge called for the adoption of a desegregation plan that involved busing 13,300 additional children at an initial start-up cost of over $1 million.</p><p>THE BUSING DEBATE<br />Busing is a plan for promoting school desegregation, by which minority students are transported to largely white schools and white students are brought to largely minority schools. It is intended to safeguard the CIVIL RIGHTS of students and to provide equal opportunity in public education. Busing is also an example of affirmative actionthat is, the attempt to undo or compensate for the effects of past discrimination. Such action is sometimes called compensatory justice.</p><p>Busing was first enacted as part of school desegregation programs in response to federal court decisions establishing that racial SEGREGATION of public schools violates the EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE of the FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT to the Constitution. In Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S. Ct. 1689, 20 L. Ed. 2d 716 (1968), and SWANN V. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD OF EDUCATION, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 28 L. Ed. 2d 554 (1971), the Supreme Court established that federal courts could require school districts to implement busing programs as a means of achieving racial INTEGRATION of public schools.</p><p>However, busing was nothing new in U.S. education. Even before these decisions, nearly 40 percent of the nation’s school children were bused to school. And before 1954, when the Court declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional in BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873, children were often bused to segregated schools that were beyond walking distance from their homes.</p><p>With the Supreme Court decisions in Green and Swann, busing became one of the most controversial topics in U.S. law and politics, particularly in the 1970s. Although the zeal for busing as a remedy for past racial injustice had waned greatly by the 1990s, busing remained a featureif many times a limited oneof most school desegregation programs and continued to inspire heated debate.</p><p>Those who are in favor of busing claim, as did the Supreme Court in Green and Swann, that racial integration in and of itself is a worthy social goal and that busing is an effective means of achieving that goal in public education. Supporters point to the harmful legacy of segregation in education. Before Brown, African-American children were schooled in separate facilities that were usually inferior to the facilities used by whites, despite official claims that they were equal. Such segregation worked to keep African Americans at a disadvantage in relation to whites. It instilled feelings of inferiority in AfricanAmerican children and seriously diminished their educational achievement and opportunities.</p><p>Supporters of busing also often claim that de facto (actual) segregation exists even decades after the CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT and the striking down of racial segregation laws, which occurred in the 1960s. A largely white, wealthy upper class and a largely minority, poor under-class, they argue, are transported, employed, housed, and educated in different settings. Often wealthy people live in the suburbs, and the poor live in the cities. Growing up in their separate neighborhoods, children from higher socioeconomic levels thus have many advantages that poorer children do not: more space at home, better nutrition and HEALTH CARE, greater cultural and intellectual stimulation, and friends and acquaintances with higher social status providing better job and career prospects. Some even compare the isolation of impoverished minorities in the United States’ inner cities with that of impoverished blacks under South Africa’s former apartheid system.</p><p>Advocates of desegregation through busing assert that these existing inequalities must not become greater and that desegregation in education will go a long way toward ending them and creating a more just society. They also point out that U.S. education has historically worked to ensure a society in which class hierarchy is minimized and social mobilityboth upward and downwardis maximized. Busing, they argue, will therefore help avoid the creation of a permanent underclass in the United States.</p><p>Supporters of busing also maintain that it is an affordable way to achieve school desegregation. While admitting that the initial start-up costs of a busing program can be large, they point to statistics that indicate the operating costs of compulsory busing are generally less than five percent of a school district’s entire budget.</p><p>Those who oppose busing make a variety of different points against it, although they do not necessarily oppose integration itself. Opponents claim that busing serves as a distraction from more important educational goals such as quality of instruction. Busing, they hold, too easily becomes a case of form over substance, in which the form of racial integration of education becomes of greater value than the substance of what is actually taught in schools. Critics of busing would rather focus on the environment in a school and in its classrooms than on achieving a particular number of each race in a school. Justice LEWIS F. POWELL JR. echoed these sentiments in an opinion to a school desegregation case, Keyes v. Denver School District, 413 U.S. 189, 93 S. Ct. 2686, 37 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1973). In Keyes, he wrote that in an era of declining student achievement, it is wrong to turn the attention of communities “from the paramount goal of quality in education to a perennially divisive debate over who is to be transported where.”</p><p>Critics also claim that busing causes white flightwhere whites move their children from integrated public schools to private and suburban schools that are largely whitewhich results in an even greater disparity between white and black, rich and poor. According to this scenario, busing only exacerbates the current situation, making public schools and cities even more the exclusive province of the poor.</p><p>Some noted experts on the issue of busing have concluded that although they favor a society that is racially integrated, the social costs of busing and the resulting white flight are too high. Others have sought a middle ground on the issue by arguing that judges should choose carefully the districts in which they decide to implement busing. For example, they claim that white flight is more likely to occur in communities and schools where whites form a small minority, and that as a result, busing has higher social costs in such districts.</p><p>Another prominent complaint in the anti-busing opinion is that court-ordered busing programs represent an abuse of judicial power. According to this view, busing is an example of undesirable judicial activism. The large-scale social changes caused by transporting thousands of children many miles each day should be imposed only by an elected body of representatives such as a state legislature or Congress. Moreover, adherents of this view argue that supervising school desegregation programs only bogs down the courts and takes time away from other pressing legal matters.</p><p>Critics of busing also point out that many times, the same court that requires busing does not provide guidance as to funding it, thereby creating financial headaches for school districts. Related to this issue is the claim that busing is too costly, especially when school districts are forced to purchase new buses in order to start a busing program. In financially strapped school districts, spending on busing sometimes takes away funding for other educational priorities.</p><p>cited:http://law.jrank.org/pages/10023/School-Desegregation-1970s-Swann-Busing.html &lt;a href=”http://law.jrank.org/pages/10023/School-Desegregation-1970s-Swann-Busing.html”&gt;School Desegregation – The 1970s: Swann And Busing&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>Food for thought!!!!

Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct-action campaign that was “well timed” in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now, I have heard the word “Wait!” It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This “Wait” has almost always meant ‘Never.” We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that “justice too long delayed is justice denied.”</p><p>We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God-given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jet-like speed toward gaining political independence, but we stiff creep at a horse-and-buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging dark of segregation to say, “Wait.” But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she can’t go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five-year-old son who is asking: “Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?”; when you take a cross-county drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading “white” and “colored”; when your first name becomes “nigger,” your middle name becomes “boy” (however old you are) and your last name becomes “John,” and your wife and mother are never given the respected title “Mrs.”; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you no forever fighting a degenerating sense of “moodiness” then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience… You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court’s decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in public schools, at first glance, it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws. One may ask: “How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?” The answer is that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the Brat to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that “an unjust law is no law at all” Now, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man-made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with moral law. To put it in terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an “I-it” relationship for an “I-thou” relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. Hence segregation is not only politically, economically, and sociologically unsound, it is morally wrong and awful. Paul Tillich said that sin is separation. Is not segregation an existential expression ‘of man’s tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? Thus, it is that I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court, for it is morally right, and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances, for they are morally wrong.</p><p>Let us consider a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself. This is a difference made legal. By the same token, a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal. Let me give another explanation. A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama, which set up that state’s segregation laws, was democratically elected? Throughout Alabama, all sorts of devious methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and there are some counties in which, even though Negroes constitute a majority of the population, not a single Negro is registered. Can any law enacted under such circumstances be considered democratically structured? Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance that requires a permit for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protest. I hope you are able to ace the distinction I am trying to point out. In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist? That would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that their conscience tells him is unjust and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice is, in reality, expressing the highest respect for law.</p><p>Of course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience.</p><p>It was evidenced sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar on the ground that a higher moral law was at stake. It was practiced superbly by the early Christians, who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks rather than submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience. In our own nation, the Boston Tea Party represented a massive act of civil disobedience….</p><p>Never before have I written so long a letter. I’m afraid it is much too long to take your precious time. I can assure you that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing from a comfortable desk, but what else can one do when he k alone in a narrow jail cell other than write long letters, think long thoughts and pray long prayers? If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the truth and indicates an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me. If I have said anything that understates the truth and indicates my having patience that allows me to settle for anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me. I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil rights leader but as a fellow clergyman and a Christian brother. Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-drenched communities, and in some not-too-distant tomorrow, the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.” Yours for the cause of Peace and Brotherhood, MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. Rev. Earnest Mason</p>",

When you look at the facts in this case, only those with personal or political agendas would conclude that race and activism are factors in her decision making.</p><p>This is not to say that Sotomayor is perfect. As a human being, she has admitted to having prejudices like all of us, but struggles with them to become a better person and judge.</p><p>The facts are clearly laid out in her 11-year 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals career. Sotomayor was involved in about 100-panel decisions on legal issues of race. During the span of this career, she only disagreed with her colleagues in decisions four times.</p><p>There was only one case (Gant v. Wallington Bd. Of Educ., 1999) in which she allowed a race discrimination claim to proceed involving a school transfer. In another case (Pappas v. Giuliani, 2002) she disagreed with her colleagues in favor of a white bigot who was fired for distributing racist materials. On two other panels, she rejected district court rulings that agreed that jury selection claims were race-based.</p><p>With such a moderate ruling history, I’m confident that this judge’s ruling in the Ricci v. New Haven case involving claims of discrimination by white firemen and one Hispanic fireman will be upheld. However, even if it’s not upheld, her record of a roughly 8 to 1 margin of rejecting discrimination-related claims does not support the vicious labels of “racist” and “activist judge.”</p><p>Given Sotomayor’s outstanding credentials and stellar job performance, it begs the question of what all the anger and name-calling are really about? Aside from distracting attention from the real deviants (Dick Cheney and George W. Bush) who disregarded the “rule of law” to achieve political objectives, this kind of unwarranted fault-finding and complaining goes much deeper than mere posturing and filibustering. The attacks against this Obama nominee crossed the line by aiming explicitly at her gender and ethnicity.</p><p>Listen, folks, I get the sense of desperation and fear expressed by many conservatives. They are obviously undergoing an identity crisis, which has created strong underlying emotions of fear, fear of being nobody, and even the fear of being irrelevant or extinct. Such powerful emotions are equivalent to the fear of death, given the unprecedented and rapid change taking place. I get that.</p><p>However, when these fears are unacknowledged and unchecked, they cause the hard right to seek winning at any cost (“the ends justify the means”), which is irresponsible and dangerous. It’s like a spider cancer whose roots are long and deep and seem impossible to dig up. It’s always lurking, ready to strike, especially since we have elected a black president. The only way to defeat this monster is to collectively rise above it, but the sane voices appear too quiet and, in some cases, totally lacking.</p><p>It always amazes me that those who judge unfairly, criticize, and condemn minorities and the poor the most have never spent one full day in an inner-city poor neighborhood in America nor engaged someone from this demographic in a close and honest relationship. Perhaps if they did so, they might have a different perception.</p><p>Because of this hypocrisy, too many Americans have been duped into believing that victims are bad guys and those who maintain the status quo are heroes. As a result, we cannot recognize and honor the qualities of someone like Sotomayor as needed and desirable. Anyone with similar mindsets as Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich are not America’s saviors. To seek to exploit the ignorance of facts and then play on the fears generated by ignorance is anti-American and unpatriotic to say the least.</p><p>The word “racist” has been misused and abused probably as much as the word “love.” A true racist is consumed with fear and insecurity and sees fundamental differences among races. The “other” is viewed as “the enemy,” which must be destroyed or silenced.</p><p>The truth is God did not create “thems” or “others,” and there is no such thing as “fundamental differences” among human beings. If Sotomayor was a racist, her misguided passions would be evident to everyone, given her high profile and in everything she does. But such facts to those who seek to repudiate and vilify her are simply a nuisance. Indeed, there are differences in human behavior, attitude, custom and experiences, but they are circumstantial and incidental.</p><p>However, we may dicker about racial heritage and culture; for anyone to read into Sotomayor’s character other than an honest accounting of her rich experiences says more about such critics than about her.</p><p>Harold Lott is a Gainesville resident and a frequent columnist.</p>",

BOARD OF EDUCATION, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954), the United States’ legal system has sought to address the problem of racial SEGREGATION, or separation, in public schools. In Brown, a unanimous Supreme Court found that segregating children of different races in distinct schools violates the Equal Protection Clause of the FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT, which guarantees that “[n]o state shall deny to any person the EQUAL PROTECTION of the laws” ( 1). In writing the Court’s opinion, Chief Justice EARL WARREN stressed the crucial role education plays in socializing children, and he maintained that racial segregation “generates a feeling of inferiority” in children that will limit their opportunities in life. A related decision, Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 75 S. Ct. 753, 99 L. Ed. 1083 (1955), (Brown II), empowered lower courts to supervise desegregation in local school districts and held that desegregation must proceed “with all deliberate speed.”</p><p>A number of Supreme Court decisions in the decades since Brown have further defined the constitutional claims regarding desegregation first set forth in Brown. In many cases, these decisions have resulted in court-imposed desegregation plans, sometimes involving controversial provisions for busing students to schools outside their immediate neighborhood. Despite such judicial actions, desegregation in the United States achieved mixed success. Although many more children attend school with children of other races now than in 1954, in numerous cities, racial segregation in education remains as high as ever. Faced with the challenges of shifting populations, segregated housing patterns, impatient courts, and the stubborn persistence of racism, comprehensive school desegregationlong a hoped-for remedy to past discrimination against African Americansremains an elusive goal.</p><p>Brown and Brown II inspired a great deal of hope that the races would soon be joined in public schools and that the United States would take a giant step toward healing the racial animosities of its past. THURGOOD MARSHALL, an African American who led the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s Legal Defense Fund in its challenge to school segregation in Brown and later became a justice of the Supreme Court, predicted that after Brown, schools would be completely desegregated within six months.</p><p>Marshall’s statement proved to be wildly optimistic. By 1964, ten years after Brown, a Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) study indicated that only 2.4 percent of African Americans in the South were attending largely white schools. Such statistics indicated that Brown had led to only token INTEGRATION. By the mid-1960s, many observers felt that the Supreme Court, and the United States as a whole, had lost an opportunity to more quickly create a desegregated society. De facto segregation (segregation in fact or actuality)as opposed to de jure segregation (segregation by law)remained a stubborn reality, and racism remained its leading cause. Whites who did not want their children attending school with children of another race found many ways to avoid desegregation, from gerrymandering school boundaries (adjusting school boundaries to their advantage) to manipulating school transportation and construction policies. And in a phenomenon dubbed white flight, many transferred their children to private schools or simply moved to suburbs where few, if any, nonwhites lived.</p><p>Congress joined the Supreme Court in its efforts to assist desegregation, by passing the CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 (28 U.S.C.A. 1447, 42 U.S.C.A. 1971, 1975a to 1975d, 2000a to 2000h-6). Among its many features, the act authorized HEW to create specific guidelines with which to measure the progress of school desegregation. In 1966, for example, these guidelines called for specific levels of integration: 16 to 18 percent of AfricanAmerican children in all school districts must be attending predominantly white schools. The act also allowed HEW to cut off federal funding to school districts that did not meet integration guidelines. However, this punishment proved difficult to use as a means of enforcement.</p><p>In the mid-1960s, a judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, JOHN MINOR WISDOM, issued a number of influential opinions that strengthened the cause of racial integration of schools. Wisdom’s rulings established that it was not enough simply to end segregation; instead, school districts must actively implement desegregation. In one of these cases, United States v. Jefferson Board of Education, 372 F.2d 836 (5th Cir. 1966), he wrote, “[T]he only adequate redress for a previously overt system-wide policy of segregation directed against Negroes as a collective entity is a system-wide policy of integration.” Wisdom’s ruling also detailed measures that the school district must take toward the goal of integration, including deciding how children were to be informed of the schools available to them for attendance, where new schools must be constructed, where transportation routes must run, and how faculty and staff were to be hired and assigned.</p><p>In 1968, the Supreme Court again addressed the issue of school desegregation, in Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S. Ct. 1689, 20 L. Ed. 2d 716, which dealt with the schools of New Kent County, a rural area in eastern Virginia. In its opinion, the Court acknowledged that the integration guidelines set forth in Brown II had not produced adequate results. School districts such as those of New Kent Countywhere in 1967, 85 percent of black children still attended an all-black schoolhad avoided meaningful integration. It was not enough, the Court argued, to simply end segregation and allow a “freedom-of-choice” planby which AfricanAmerican children supposedly had the freedom to attend predominantly white schoolsto be the only means of combining the races in an educational setting. In comments during Court hearings on the case, Chief Justice Warren noted that though the “fence” of outright segregation had been taken down, socially constructed “booby traps” still prevented most children from attending integrated schools.</p><p>In SWANN V. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD OF EDUCATION, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 28 L. Ed. 2d 554 (1971), the focus of school desegregation shifted from largely rural school districts to urban ones, a change of scene that offered new challenges to desegregation. In the rural South before the Brown decision, blacks and whites lived largely in the same communities or areas, and requiring that their children attend the same neighborhood schools could resolve segregation. In urban settings, however, blacks and whites lived in different neighborhoods, so combining the two races in the same schools meant transporting children, usually by bus, to institutions that were often far from their homes.</p><p>In Swann, the Court took the final step toward making busing a part of school desegregation plans, by giving the lower courts power to impose it as a means for achieving integration. Swann involved the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District, in North Carolina, a district in which African Americans made up 29 percent of the student body. After the Supreme Court’s decision in Green, a federal district judge ruled that the school district had not achieved adequate levels of integration: 14,000 of the 24,000 AfricanAmerican students still attended schools that were all black, and most of the 24,000 did not have any white teachers. The judge called for the adoption of a desegregation plan that involved busing 13,300 additional children at an initial start-up cost of over $1 million.</p><p>THE BUSING DEBATE<br />Busing is a plan for promoting school desegregation, by which minority students are transported to largely white schools and white students are brought to largely minority schools. It is intended to safeguard the CIVIL RIGHTS of students and to provide equal opportunity in public education. Busing is also an example of affirmative actionthat is, the attempt to undo or compensate for the effects of past discrimination. Such action is sometimes called compensatory justice.</p><p>Busing was first enacted as part of school desegregation programs in response to federal court decisions establishing that racial SEGREGATION of public schools violates the EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE of the FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT to the Constitution. In Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S. Ct. 1689, 20 L. Ed. 2d 716 (1968), and SWANN V. CHARLOTTE-MECKLENBURG BOARD OF EDUCATION, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 28 L. Ed. 2d 554 (1971), the Supreme Court established that federal courts could require school districts to implement busing programs as a means of achieving racial INTEGRATION of public schools.</p><p>However, busing was nothing new in U.S. education. Even before these decisions, nearly 40 percent of the nation’s school children were bused to school. And before 1954, when the Court declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional in BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873, children were often bused to segregated schools that were beyond walking distance from their homes.</p><p>With the Supreme Court decisions in Green and Swann, busing became one of the most controversial topics in U.S. law and politics, particularly in the 1970s. Although the zeal for busing as a remedy for past racial injustice had waned greatly by the 1990s, busing remained a featureif many times a limited oneof most school desegregation programs and continued to inspire heated debate.</p><p>Those who are in favor of busing claim, as did the Supreme Court in Green and Swann, that racial integration in and of itself is a worthy social goal and that busing is an effective means of achieving that goal in public education. Supporters point to the harmful legacy of segregation in education. Before Brown, African-American children were schooled in separate facilities that were usually inferior to the facilities used by whites, despite official claims that they were equal. Such segregation worked to keep African Americans at a disadvantage in relation to whites. It instilled feelings of inferiority in AfricanAmerican children and seriously diminished their educational achievement and opportunities.</p><p>Supporters of busing also often claim that de facto (actual) segregation exists even decades after the CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT and the striking down of racial segregation laws, which occurred in the 1960s. A largely white, wealthy upper class and a largely minority, poor under-class, they argue, are transported, employed, housed, and educated in different settings. Often wealthy people live in the suburbs, and the poor live in the cities. Growing up in their separate neighborhoods, children from higher socioeconomic levels thus have many advantages that poorer children do not: more space at home, better nutrition and HEALTH CARE, greater cultural and intellectual stimulation, and friends and acquaintances with higher social status providing better job and career prospects. Some even compare the isolation of impoverished minorities in the United States’ inner cities with that of impoverished blacks under South Africa’s former apartheid system.</p><p>Advocates of desegregation through busing assert that these existing inequalities must not become greater and that desegregation in education will go a long way toward ending them and creating a more just society. They also point out that U.S. education has historically worked to ensure a society in which class hierarchy is minimized and social mobilityboth upward and downwardis maximized. Busing, they argue, will therefore help avoid the creation of a permanent underclass in the United States.</p><p>Supporters of busing also maintain that it is an affordable way to achieve school desegregation. While admitting that the initial start-up costs of a busing program can be large, they point to statistics that indicate the operating costs of compulsory busing are generally less than five percent of a school district’s entire budget.</p><p>Those who oppose busing make a variety of different points against it, although they do not necessarily oppose integration itself. Opponents claim that busing serves as a distraction from more important educational goals such as quality of instruction. Busing, they hold, too easily becomes a case of form over substance, in which the form of racial integration of education becomes of greater value than the substance of what is actually taught in schools. Critics of busing would rather focus on the environment in a school and in its classrooms than on achieving a particular number of each race in a school. Justice LEWIS F. POWELL JR. echoed these sentiments in an opinion to a school desegregation case, Keyes v. Denver School District, 413 U.S. 189, 93 S. Ct. 2686, 37 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1973). In Keyes, he wrote that in an era of declining student achievement, it is wrong to turn the attention of communities “from the paramount goal of quality in education to a perennially divisive debate over who is to be transported where.”</p><p>Critics also claim that busing causes white flightwhere whites move their children from integrated public schools to private and suburban schools that are largely whitewhich results in an even greater disparity between white and black, rich and poor. According to this scenario, busing only exacerbates the current situation, making public schools and cities even more the exclusive province of the poor.</p><p>Some noted experts on the issue of busing have concluded that although they favor a society that is racially integrated, the social costs of busing and the resulting white flight are too high. Others have sought a middle ground on the issue by arguing that judges should choose carefully the districts in which they decide to implement busing. For example, they claim that white flight is more likely to occur in communities and schools where whites form a small minority, and that as a result, busing has higher social costs in such districts.</p><p>Another prominent complaint in the anti-busing opinion is that court-ordered busing programs represent an abuse of judicial power. According to this view, busing is an example of undesirable judicial activism. The large-scale social changes caused by transporting thousands of children many miles each day should be imposed only by an elected body of representatives such as a state legislature or Congress. Moreover, adherents of this view argue that supervising school desegregation programs only bogs down the courts and takes time away from other pressing legal matters.</p><p>Critics of busing also point out that many times, the same court that requires busing does not provide guidance as to funding it, thereby creating financial headaches for school districts. Related to this issue is the claim that busing is too costly, especially when school districts are forced to purchase new buses in order to start a busing program. In financially strapped school districts, spending on busing sometimes takes away funding for other educational priorities.</p><p>cited:http://law.jrank.org/pages/10023/School-Desegregation-1970s-Swann-Busing.html &lt;a href=”http://law.jrank.org/pages/10023/School-Desegregation-1970s-Swann-Busing.html”&gt;School Desegregation – The 1970s: Swann And Busing&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>Food for thought!!!!

It instilled feelings of inferiority in AfricanAmerican children and seriously diminished their educational achievement and opportunities.</p><p>Supporters of busing also often claim that de facto (actual) segregation exists even decades after the CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT and the striking down of racial segregation laws, which occurred in the 1960s. A largely white, wealthy upper class and a largely minority, poor under-class, they argue, are transported, employed, housed, and educated in different settings. Often wealthy people live in the suburbs, and the poor live in the cities. Growing up in their separate neighborhoods, children from higher socioeconomic levels thus have many advantages that poorer children do not: more space at home, better nutrition and HEALTH CARE, greater cultural and intellectual stimulation, and friends and acquaintances with higher social status providing better job and career prospects. Some even compare the isolation of impoverished minorities in the United States’ inner cities with that of impoverished blacks under South Africa’s former apartheid system.</p><p>Advocates of desegregation through busing assert that these existing inequalities must not become greater and that desegregation in education will go a long way toward ending them and creating a more just society. They also point out that U.S. education has historically worked to ensure a society in which class hierarchy is minimized and social mobilityboth upward and downwardis maximized. Busing, they argue, will therefore help avoid the creation of a permanent underclass in the United States.</p><p>Supporters of busing also maintain that it is an affordable way to achieve school desegregation. While admitting that the initial start-up costs of a busing program can be large, they point to statistics that indicate the operating costs of compulsory busing are generally less than five percent of a school district’s entire budget.</p><p>Those who oppose busing make a variety of different points against it, although they do not necessarily oppose integration itself. Opponents claim that busing serves as a distraction from more important educational goals such as quality of instruction. Busing, they hold, too easily becomes a case of form over substance, in which the form of racial integration of education becomes of greater value than the substance of what is actually taught in schools. Critics of busing would rather focus on the environment in a school and in its classrooms than on achieving a particular number of each race in a school. Justice LEWIS F. POWELL JR. echoed these sentiments in an opinion to a school desegregation case, Keyes v. Denver School District, 413 U.S. 189, 93 S. Ct. 2686, 37 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1973). In Keyes, he wrote that in an era of declining student achievement, it is wrong to turn the attention of communities “from the paramount goal of quality in education to a perennially divisive debate over who is to be transported where.”</p><p>Critics also claim that busing causes white flightwhere whites move their children from integrated public schools to private and suburban schools that are largely whitewhich results in an even greater disparity between white and black, rich and poor. According to this scenario, busing only exacerbates the current situation, making public schools and cities even more the exclusive province of the poor.</p><p>Some noted experts on the issue of busing have concluded that although they favor a society that is racially integrated, the social costs of busing and the resulting white flight are too high. Others have sought a middle ground on the issue by arguing that judges should choose carefully the districts in which they decide to implement busing. For example, they claim that white flight is more likely to occur in communities and schools where whites form a small minority, and that as a result, busing has higher social costs in such districts.</p><p>Another prominent complaint in the anti-busing opinion is that court-ordered busing programs represent an abuse of judicial power. According to this view, busing is an example of undesirable judicial activism. The large-scale social changes caused by transporting thousands of children many miles each day should be imposed only by an elected body of representatives such as a state legislature or Congress. Moreover, adherents of this view argue that supervising school desegregation programs only bogs down the courts and takes time away from other pressing legal matters.</p><p>Critics of busing also point out that many times, the same court that requires busing does not provide guidance as to funding it, thereby creating financial headaches for school districts. Related to this issue is the claim that busing is too costly, especially when school districts are forced to purchase new buses in order to start a busing program. In financially strapped school districts, spending on busing sometimes takes away funding for other educational priorities.</p><p>cited:http://law.jrank.org/pages/10023/School-Desegregation-1970s-Swann-Busing.html &lt;a href=”http://law.jrank.org/pages/10023/School-Desegregation-1970s-Swann-Busing.html”&gt;School Desegregation – The 1970s: Swann And Busing&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>Food for thought!!!!

Only a true Southerner knows the difference between a hissy fit and a conniption and that you don’t “HAVE” them.–<br />you “PITCH” them.</p><p>2.) Only a true Southerner knows how many fish, collard greens, turnip greens, peas, beans, etc., make up “a mess.”</p><p>3.) Only a true Southerner can show or point out to you the general direction of “yonder.”</p><p>4.) Only a true Southerner knows exactly how long “directly” is – as in: “Going to town, be back directly.”</p><p>5.) All true Southerners, even babies, know that “Gimme some sugar” is not a request for the white, granular sweet substance in a pretty little bowl on the middle of the table.</p><p>6.) All true Southerners know exactly when “by and by” is.<br />They might not use the term, but they know the concept well.</p><p>7.) Only a true Southerner knows instinctively that the best gesture of solace for a neighbor who’s got trouble is a plate of hot fried chicken and a big bowl of cold potato salad. (If the neighbor’s trouble is a real crisis, they also know to add a large banana puddin’!)</p><p>8.) Only true Southerners grow up knowing the difference between “right near” and “a right far piece.” They also know that “just down the road” can be 1 mile or 20.</p><p>9.) No true Southerner would ever assume that the car with the flashing turn signal is actually going to make a turn.</p><p>10.) A true Southerner knows that “fixin'” can be used as a noun, a verb, or an adverb.</p><p>11.) Only a true Southerner knows that the term “booger” can be a resident of the nose, a descriptive, as in “that ol’ booger,” a first name or something that jumps out at you in the dark and scares you senseless.</p><p>12.) Only true Southerners make friends while standing in lines. We don’t do “queues”, we do “lines,” and when we’re “in line,” we talk to everybody!</p><p>13.) Put 100 true Southerners in a room and half of them will discover they’re related, even if only by marriage.</p><p>14.) True Southerners never refer to one person as “y’all.”</p><p>15.) True Southerners know grits come from corn and how to eat them.</p><p>16.) Every true Southerner knows tomatoes with eggs, bacon, grits, and coffee are perfectly wonderful; that redeye gravy is also a breakfast food; and that fried green tomatoes are not a breakfast food.</p><p>17.) When you hear someone say, “Well, I caught myself lookin’ .. ,” you know you are in the presence of a genuine Southerner!</p><p>18.) Only true Southerners say “sweet tea” and “sweet milk.” Sweet tea indicates the need for sugar and lots of it – we do not like our tea unsweetened. “Sweet milk” means you don’t want buttermilk.</p><p>19.) And a true Southerner knows you don’t scream obscenities at little old ladies who drive 30 MPH on the freeway. You just say, “Bless her heart” and go your own way.</p><p>20.) Only a true Southerner knows ‘chaps’ stay put on the porch until told otherwise.</p><p>21.) Only a true Southerner knows the difference between liver puddin’ and scrapple.<br />MLC Sent from my iPhone</p>",
